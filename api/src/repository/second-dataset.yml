Hey ho, lets go!
Hey ho, lets go!
Hey ho, lets go!
Hey ho, lets go!
They're forming in a straight line
They're goin in a tight wind
The kids are losing their minds
Blitzkrieg bop
They're piling in the backseat
They're generation steam heat
Pulsating to the back seat
Blitzkrieg bop
Hey ho lets go
Shoot em' in the back now
What they want, I don't know
They're all reved up and ready to go
They're forming in a straight line
They're goin through a tight wind
The kids are losing their minds
Blitzkrieg bop
They're piling in the backseat
They're generation steam heat
Pulsating to the back seat
Blitzkrieg bop
Hey ho lets go
Shoot em' in the back now
What they want, I don't know
They're all reved up and ready to go
They're forming in a straight line
They're goin through a tight wind
The kids are losing their minds
Blitzkrieg bop
They're piling in the backseat
They're generation steam heat
Pulsating to the back seat
Blitzkrieg bop
Hey ho lets go
Shoot em' in the back now
What they want, I don't know
They're all reved up and ready to go
Hey ho, lets go!
Hey ho, lets go!
Hey ho, lets go!
Hey ho, lets go!
