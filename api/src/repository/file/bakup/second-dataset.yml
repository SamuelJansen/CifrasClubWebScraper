Esta aqui é p'ra malta da pesada
Que sofre com o SLB a valer
Não há como uma boa Rockalhada
Pa por o nosso glorioso a mexer
O Estádio da Luz já está ao rubro
Oitenta mil goelas a cantar
E no meio disto tudo é que eu descubro
Que o Benfica já está a golear
Benfica vai p'rá frente com genica
Até ganharmos tudo que há pra ganhar
Vamos cantar o rock do Benfica
Pa por o estádio da luz a vibrar
Quero ver as bandeiras no ar
E as caras pintadas de encarnado
A onda está ai, está a chegar
Já estou a ver o pessoal levantado
As claques não deixam de gritar
SLB até à exaustão
Há só uma coisa que as pode parar
É a outra equipa pedir a rendição
Benfica vai p'rá frente com genica
Até ganharmos tudo que há pra ganhar
Vamos cantar o rock do Benfica
Pa por o estádio da luz a vibrar

I would cut my legs and tits off
When I think of Boris Karloff and Kinski
In the dark of the moon
It made me dream of Nosferatu
Trapped on the isle of Doctor Moreau
Oh wouldn't it be lovely
I was thinking Peter Lorre
When things got pretty gory as I
Crossed to the Brandenburg Gate
I was feeling snappy perhaps I'd been napping
And I'd just ate
A following heart can tear you apart
On a midnight to 8 shift
A graveyard romance can only give one chance
As the tombstones weave and breathe
Feeling happy when my heart got beating
On a Sunday afternoon
I dreamt of breezes going through the treeses
And stars were still illumed
I have three hearts that I keep apart
Trying to relate
To normal feelings and the nightime reelings
And some absynthe drunk so late
The cook got drunk and all the whores they shrunk
Onto the size of dessert plates
But me I'm happy cause I got my little nappy
And some opium to set me straight
I'm just a small town girl who wants to give it a whirl
While my looks still hold me straight
Straight up to illusion and fantasy's fusion
Of reality mixed with drink
I'm just a small town girl who's gonna give life a whirl
Looking at the Brandenburg Gate

There I was completely wasting
Out of work and down
All inside it's so frustrating
As I drift from town to town
Feel as though nobody cares
If I live or die
So I might as well begin
To put some action in my life
Breaking the law, breaking the law
So much for the golden future
I can't even start
I've had every promise broken
And there's anger in my heart
You don't know what it's like
You don't have a clue
If you did you'd find yourselves
Doing the same thing too
Breaking the law, breaking the law
You don't know what it's like

Born to push you around
You better just stay down
You pull away
He hits the flesh
You hit the ground
Mouth so full of lies
Tend to black your eyes
Just keep them closed
Keep praying
Just keep waiting
Waiting for the one
The day that never comes
When you stand up and feel the warmth
But the son shine never comes
No, the son shine never comes
Push you cross that line
Just stay down this time
Hide in yourself
Crawl in yourself
You'll have your time
God I'll make them pay
Take it back one day
I'll end this day
I'll splatter color on this gray
Waiting for the one
The day that never comes
When you stand up and feel the warmth
But the son shine never comes, no
Love is a four letter word
And never spoken here
Love is a four letter word
In this prison
Love is a four letter word
And never spoken here
Love is a four letter word
Here in this prison
And I will wait no longer
I put an end to this
This I swear

The son will shine

Why do you cheat on me
Why do I cheat on thee
Why do I cheat on me
Why do I cheat on me
I have a passionate heart
It can tear us apart
I have the loves of many men
But I don't love any of them
Why do I cheat on me
You have your feelings
I have mine
I spit upon you and change my mind
I have many hearts to break
And many, many, many more to take
Let the light of stars pour out
Like a candle in a spout
Let the wick recede and break
Let the starlight radiate
Why do you cheat on me
Why do I cheat on me
Why do I cheat on thee
Why do I desecrate me
Why do I piss my dreams
That's because that's what it is
I have the drive
I got the scope
If I, if I, if I, could I give you a rope
Your love means zero to me
I'm a passionateless wave upon the sea
Passionateless wave upon the sea
Why, why, why
Do you cheat on me
Why, why, why
Do I cheat on thee
Oh why, do I cheat on me
Why do I cheat on myself
Well I got nobody else
I'm only young once
I want to taste it all and have fun
I have no real feelings in my soul
Where most have passion I got a hole
I really got nobody else
I want lovers like the rain
So many of them, so much the same
You say you love me, I know it's true
But I, I, I don't love you
Why do I cheat on me
Why do you cheat on me
Your love means zero to me
A passionateless wave
Your love means zero to me

I'm for law and order, the way that it should be.
This song's about the night they spent protecting you from me.
Someone called this outlaw, in some ol' magazine.
New York sent a posse down like I ain't never seen.
Don't you think this outlaw bit has done got out of hand?
What started out to be a joke, the law don't understand.
Was it singing through my nose that got me busted by the man?
Maybe this here outlaw bit has done got out of hand.
We were wrapped up in our music, that's why we never saw,
The cars pull up, the boys get out and the room fill up with law.
They came pounding through the back door in the middle of the song.
They got me for possession of something that was gone, long gone.
Don't you think this outlaw bit has done got out of hand?
What started out to be a joke, the law don't understand.
Was it singing through my nose that got me busted by the man?
Maybe this here outlaw bit has done got out of hand.
Don't you think this outlaw bit has done got out of hand, out of hand?

You don't actually care
Love for you is no beginning
You're not really there
Hallucination
I thought you were listening
Hallucination
I thought you were listening
Hallucination
I understand you think you're above it
The adolescent sense of the sky
The feeling of billowing heartbeats
The fingertips run through your hair
They run through your hair
Hallucination
Hallucination
Oh you think you're so special
That there's no law meant for you
You come and go like the goddess you are
We're mere mortals below
Fingertips run through your hair
We are mere mortals below
Are meant to be peons
Are meant to be servants
Are meant to be dismissible objects
One fucks with
One fucks with
Poor pitiful creature
The winner in heartbreak
The winner in caring
The winner in every miniscule method of wearing
Your heart on your sleeve
A red star of idiocy
An idiot's idiocy
My, my caring for you
Caring for you
Do you think we're a book
Some kind of a table
You can rest your feet on when you're able
Red star of idiocy
An idiot's idiocy
My caring for you
Poor pitiful creature
To notice the pining
The self deprivation
The self flagellation of you
Dear worshippers
We do like you regal
We do like you haughty
We do love to look upon your perfect body
The hair on your shoulders
The smell of your armpit
The taste of your vulva and everything on it
We all really love you
And you have no meaning
You don't even see us
You were never caring
You go do what you do
You do it for you
No one exists with you
You're way above caring
Leave a trail upon the wake
That no one ever tries to take
Because waiting for you
Thinking of you
Is another way of dying
Is another way of dying
I'm clawing your chest
'Til your collarbone bleeds
Piercing your nipples 'til I bite them off
I scratch your face and bite your shoulders
Way above caring
Way above caring
And your Kotex jukebox
Your Kotex jukebox
I'm doomed, I'm swearing
Waiting for you
In your high heels and nightie
Your leather dress squeaking
Latex now sweating, waiting for you
In your tincture
Your opium white bathrobe
Your white tiles run red now
Are we both dead now?
The liquid exchange of our heart
The liquid exchange of our heart
Are we both dead now?
You're way above caring
Your heart on your sleeve
A red star of idiocy
An idiot's idiocy
My caring
My caring for you
My caring for you
You're way beyond caring
Your heart on your sleeve
A red star of idiocy
An idiot's idiocy
My caring for you
Oblivious to caring
Oblivious to caring
Oblivious to caring
Leave a trail upon the wake
That no one ever tries to take
Because waiting for you
Because thinking of you
Is another way of dying
You're way above caring
Oblivious to caring
Oblivious to caring
You poor pitiful creature
The mistake of feeling
The one who rejects you is the winner,
It's true
The winner in heartbreak
The winner in caring
The winner in every miniscule method of wearing
Your heart on your sleeve
A red star of idiocy
An idiot's idiocy
Your heart on your fuckin' sleeve
My caring for you
We were meant to be peons
We're meant to be peons
Mere mortals below
Meant to be servants
Meant to be dismissible objects one fucks with
Oh, oh, oh you're so special
No law meant for you
You come and go like the goddess you are
The fingertips run through your hair
A billowing heart beats
Feeling
Feeling
What a glorious feeling
To be so rejected
So rejected
An idiot's idiocy
My caring for you
You think I'm a book or a table
You can rest your fuckin' feet on
When you're able
The taste of your vulva, everything on it
The hair on your shoulders
The smell of your armpit
We do love you, to look upon your perfect body
We love you regal
We love you haughty
Oblivious to caring
Oblivious to caring
Caring
Oh my dear
Oh my dear
Oh my dear
Oblivious to caring
Are we really dead now?
Are we both dead now?

Luck (luck, luck), Runs (runs, runs), Out (out, out)
Crawling from the wreckage one more time
This map is tattered, can't free the signs
Though the body's rusted
Isn't hard to turn
On the path of destruction, feel it burn
Feel safe, in the danger
Feel good, in the bad
God! The burning, I've got the speed
Loose your turn, you crash and burn, you walk away
'Cause it ain't no good when there's nothing
Ain't no good when you can't go wrong
Crash and burn then you walk away
How many times can I hear you say
Ain't no good when there's nothing
Ain't no good when you can't go wrong, yeah
Luck, runs, out
You crawl back in, but your luck runs out
Luck (luck,luck), Runs (runs,runs), Out (out,out)
In love with my struggle
In love with my pain
Much needed to keep me down again
Don't allow myself to feel too good
Unworthy of me, couldn't if I could
Feel safe, in the danger
Feel good, in the bad
God! The burning, I've got the speed
Loose your turn, you crash and burn, you walk away

How many times can I hear you say
Ain't no good when there's nothing
Ain't no good when you can't go wrong, yeah
Luck, runs, out
You crawl back in, but your luck runs out
And you crawl back in
Deep in your obsession
Since you've crashed and burned
This is your confession
Ain't no good when there's nothing
Ain't no good when you can't go wrong
Crash and burn then you walk away
How many times can I hear you say
Ain't no good when there's nothing
Ain't no good when you can't go wrong, yeah

Frustration
In my lexicon of hate
I see you with your portraiture
Does he love you?
Does he love you too?
The brush strokes
Kiss your breasts and toes
I cry icicles in my stein
The heartbeats flutter
With an abnormal rhythm
The pain shoots through my body
A sword between my thighs
I wish that I could kill you
But I too love your eyes
You're feeling less whore but you stimulate
The hatred smolders in your eyes
I'd drop to my knees in a second
To salivate in your thighs
But all I do is fall over
I don't have the strength I once had
In you and your prickless lover
And his easel in his eyes
I feel the pain creep up my leg
Blood runs from my nose
I puke my guts out at your feet
You're more man than I
To be dead to have no feeling
To be dry and spermless like a girl
I want so much to hurt you
I want so much to hurt you
I want so much to hurt you
Marry me
I want you as my wife
Spermless like a girl
More man than I
More man than I
Frustration
In my lexicon of hate
You're feeling less like a whore but you
Stimulate
All I do is fall over
I don't have the strength I once had
All I do is fall over
I don't have the strength I once had
I want you so much to hurt you
I want so much to hurt you
I want so much to hurt you
I want you as a wife
Frustration is my lexicon of hate
Frustration is my lexicon of hate
Fru… fru… frustration, my lexicon of hate
I cry icicles
Heartbeats flutter
Abnormal rhythm
I wish that I could kill you
But I too love your eyes
I want you as my wife
I want you as my wife
Spermless like a girl
Lucky in feeling
More man than I
Marry me, marry me, marry me
I want you as a wife
Spermless like a girl
Puking my guts at your feet
More man than I
Fru… fru… fru… frustration
Frustration

Strole through graveyard rows
Row after row
Stone without soul
Or sorrow.
Empty, are they?
Death, won't you let me stay.
Empty, are they?
Death, won't you call my name.
Angelhead, I'm already dead
It's just the funeral I've been waiting for
Angelface, mother full of grace
Touch me so we'll be together, forever
And ever and evermore.
Crow the lonely crow
I think he knows
I'm lonely too
So lonely
Empty, are they?
Death, Won't you let me stay.
Empty, are they?
Death, Won't you call my name.
Angelhead, I'm already dead
It's just the funeral I've been waiting for
Angelface, mother full of grace
Touch me so we'll be together, forever
And ever and evermore.
Is that rain or are they tears
That stain the concrete face for years
The crying, weeping, shedding all
It's fall to winter
Back to fall.
An air of freshly broken ground
A concrete angel it'll down
Upon the new stone with my name
It's peace at least
Oh, peace at last.
Empty, are they?
Death, Won't you let, me, stay.
Empty, are they?
Death, Won't you call, my, name.

When the words have all been said
When you've made upon your bed
When the codes have all been cracked
When you've double backed your tracks
So what now?
Where go I?
When it seems it's all said and done
When the storm is up and gone
When the battle has been done
When the races have been run
When the songs have all been sung
So what now?
Where go I?
When it seems it's all said and done
Start the fire
Start the fire
Spark the wire
C'mon, start the fire
You drink the dirty water
You put the fire out
Your drink the dirty water
You put your fire out
When the room it hits so clean
When the scenes have all been seen
When the roads have all been cleared
When the fears are all unfeared
And what now?
Where go I?
When it seem it's all said and done
When the pieces have been matched
When the itches have been scratched
When the courses have been run
When the songs have all been sung
So what now?
Where go I?
When it seems it's all said and done
Start the fire
Start the fire
Spark the wire
Start the fire
You drink the dirty water
You put the fire out
Your drink the dirty water
You put your fire out
On your feet or on your knees
Freedom is just one of these
Start the fire
Start the fire
Spark the wire
Start the fire
You drink the dirty water
You put the fire out
Your drink the dirty water
You put your fire out

Hate is a train
That thunders aimless through my head
And hate is the fame
Chained to the wheel until i'm dead
Rage is a flame
Creates a touch to boil the seas
And rage is to blame
Forever sorry i shall be
And from a darkness i descend
Clenching a torch of sweet revenge
You took away tomorrow, still i stand
I ride into the sorrow, still i stand
You took away tomorrow, still i stand
Straight down into the sorrow, but still i stand
Wrath is the name
Branding suffer onto you
And wrath takes the shame
And holds me down until its through
And from a darkness i descend
Clenching a torch of sweet revenge
You took away tomorrow, still i stand
I ride into the sorrow, still i stand
You took away tomorrow, still i stand
I sink into the sorrow, but still i stand
And hate is a train
They'd hung for those fleshes carved
And hate takes the blame
A beast that never slows at all
And from a darkness i descend
Clenching a torch of sweet revenge
Burst into flame, the bitter end
And shake the gates of hell again
Cursed to drown in sorrow
You took away tomorrow, still i stand
I ride into the sorrow, still i stand
You took away tomorrow, still i stand
You left me here with sorrow, still i stand

Like a siren in my head and there is no emergency,
Like a blind man that is strapped into the speeding driver's seat,
Like a face that learned to speak, when all it knew was how to bite,
Like a hurt that keeps me focused though I think I've gone astray,
Like an endless nightmare that I must awaken from each day.
Like a dream, a beautiful dream, not worthy of so I deny... I deny.
You close your eyes and try to wish it all into place,
You never open them, so it passed you by.
You close your eyes, so you may never fall from grace
You open just in time to say goodbye.
Almost like your life,
Almost like your endless fight,
Struggling along,
Balancing and runnin' wrong
Why is this so hard,
Always pull the joker card,
Almost like your fight,
And there it went,
Almost like your life.
Like a wound that keeps on bleeding to remind me not to think,
Like a spring that can't be uncovered until it's time to drink,
Like a puzzle, with missing pieces, and the box is thrown away.
Like a release from prison that you didn't know you're in,
Like a fight to live the past I prayed to leave from way back then,
Like a general without a mission until the wars will start again.
You close your eyes and try to wish it all into place,
You never opened them so it passed you by.
You close your eyes so you may never fall from grace,
You open just in time to say goodbye.
Almost like your life,
Almost like your endless fight,
Struggling along,
Balancing and runnin' wrong
Why is this so hard,
Always pull the joker card,
Almost like your fight,
And there it went,
Almost like your life.
Like a touch from hell to feel how hot that it can get if you get caught,
Like a touch from heaven and honest brise that brings you straight down to your knees
Like a touch from hell to feel how hot that it can get if you get caught,
Like a touch from heaven and honest brise that brings you straight down to your knees
Almost like your life,
Almost like your endless fight,
Struggling along,
Balancing and runnin' wrong
Why is this so hard,
Always pull the joker card,
Almost like your fight,
And there it went,
Almost like your life.
That was just your life.

Asking nothing, leave me be
Taking everything in my stride

You can't put a butterfly in a jar
If the effort's too high no matter who you are
You can't catch the moon, or the sun or the stars
It doesn't matter who you are
Iced honey
Now me I've tried a million tricks
To make life cold and make it stick
Not running heat that flames then out
But the proud piece of ice that always floats
Iced honey
If I can't trap a butterfly or a bee
If I can't keep my heart where I want it to be
If no matter how much soul and heart
I put to the wood
If a flaming heart is not that good
Iced honey
If you can't put a butterfly in a jar
If violence mars your final hour
If you make others feel like jam
Poured on a piece of charbroiled lamb
If it's all mixed up and you cannot shout
And your oxygen starts to run out
If your final gasp has the recipe wrong
And instead of hello you say so long
If your energy starts to leak out
And people wonder what you're all about
A heartbreaker with an unattached heart
The story of love gives them all a start
And me, I've always been this way
Not by choice, just this way
I can't put my honey pot in a jar
Or a heart or a fist of some young boy
If you can't put a butterfly in a jar
No wonder no need to wonder where you are
It might seem like hell, the River Styx
Your affection never sticks
No matter what you say, no matter what you do
A butterfly heart flies right past you
There's nothing to say, nothing to do
See if the ice will melt for you
Iced honey

I am Iron Man
Has he lost his mind?
Can he see or is he blind?
Can he walk at all,
Or if he moves will he fall?
Is he alive or dead?
Has he thoughts within his head?
Well just pass him there
Why should we even care?
He was turned to steel
In the great magnetic field
Where he traveled time
For the future of mankind
Nobody wants him
He just stares at the world
Planning his vengeance
That he will soon unfold
Now the time is here
For iron man to spread fear
Vengeance from the grave
Kills the people he once saved
Nobody wants him
They just turn their heads
Nobody helps him
Now he has his revenge
Heavy boots of lead
Fills his victims full of dread
Running as fast as they can
Iron man lives again!

Finished with my woman
'Cause she couldn't help me with my mind
People think I'm insane
Because I am frowning all the time
All day long I think of things
But nothing seems to satisfy
Think I'll lose my mind
If I don't find something to pacify
Can you help me?
Occupy my brain?
Oh, yeah
I need someone to show me
The things in life that I can't find
I can't see the things that make true happiness
I must be blind
Make a joke, and I will sigh
And you will laugh, and I will cry
Happiness I cannot feel
And love to me is so unreal
And so as you hear these words
Telling you now of my state
I tell you to enjoy life
I wish I could
But it's too late

Would you come to me
If I was half drowning
An arm above the last wave
Would you come to me
Would you pull me up
Would the effort really hurt you
Is it unfair to ask you
To help pull me up
The window broke the silence of the matches
The smoke effortlessly floating
Pull me up
Would you be my lord and savior
Pull me up by my hair
Now would you kiss me, on my lips
Burning fever burning on my forehead
The brain that once was listening now
Shoots out its tiresome message
Won't you pull me up
Scalding, my dead father
Has the motor and he's driving towards
An island of lost souls
Sunny, a monkey then to monkey
I will teach you meanness, fear and blindness
No social redeeming kindness
Or - oh, state of grace
Would you pull me up
Would you drop the mental bullet
Would you pull me by the arm up
Would you still kiss my lips
Hiccup, the dream is over
Get the coffee, turn the lights on
Say hello to junior dad
The greatest disappointment
Age withered him and changed him
Into junior dad
Psychic savagery
The greatest disappointment
The greatest disappointment
Age withered him and changed him
Into junior dad

Darkest Color
Blistered Earth
True Death of Life
Never Hunger

I Have Fallen Prey to Failure
Struggle Within
Triggered Again

Exploiting Their Supremacy

So True
So Real
Apathy Their Stepping Stone
So Unfeeling
Hidden Deep Animosity
So Deceiving
Through Your Eyes Their Light Burns
Hoping to Find
Inquisition Sinking You

Ride the Lightning
Guilty as charged
But damn it, ain't right
There is someone else controlling me
Death in the air
Strapped in the electric chair
This can't be happening to me
Who made you God to say
"I'll take your life from you!"
Flash before my eyes
Now it's time to die
Burning in my brain
I can feel the flames
No Remorse
No mercy for what we are doing
No thought to even what we have done
We don't need to feel the sorrow
No remorse for the helpless one
War without end
No remorse No repent
We don't care what it meant
Another day Another death
Another sorrow Another breath
No remorse No repent
We don't care what it meant
Another day Another death
Another sorrow Another breath
Hit the Lights
No life till leather
We are gonna kick some ass tonight
We got the metal madness
When our fans start screaming
It's right well all right
When we start to rock
We never want to stop again
Hit the lights
Hit the lights
Hit the lights
You know our fans are insane
We are gonna blow this place away
With volume higher
Than anything today the only way
When we start to rock
We never want to stop again
Hit the lights
Hit the lights
Hit the lights
The Four Horsemen
Time
Has taken its toll on you
The lines that crack you face
Famine
Your body it has torn through
Withered in every place
Pestilence
For what you have had to endure
And what you have put others through
Death deliverance for you for sure
There is nothing you can do
Phantom Lord
Sound is ripping through your ears
The deafening waiting for his whips
The taste of leather on you lips
Your bodies waiting for his whips
The taste of leather on you lips
Hear the cry of War
Louder than before
With this sword in hand
To control the land
Crushing metal strikes
On this frightening night
Fall onto your knees
For the Phantom Lord
Victims falling under chains
Your hear them crying death pains
The fists of terrors breaking through
Now there's nothing you can do
Hear the cry of War
Louder than before
With this sword in hand
To control the land
Crushing metal strikes
On this frightening night
Fall onto your knees
For the Phantom Lord
Fight Fire with Fire
Soon to fill our lungs the hot winds of death
The gods are laughing, so take your last breath
Fight fire with fire
Ending is near
Fight fire with fire
Bursting with fear
Fight fire with fire
Fight fire with fire
Ending is near
Fight fire with fire
Bursting with fear
Fight fire with fire

Gleam of a blade
And the devil was paid
When the axe comes down
A chilling sound
Steel hits the head
Another rabbit's dead

A guitar player
With a nasty habit
Kill the rabbit!

Little dog who can't get in
Moaning at the bed side
Moaning from each limb
Little dog who can't get in
Can only cry but
Can not swim
Pony legs, little trot
Little dog has to wait a lot
The bigger dog has got his spot
And elbowed him away
Listen to him barking
Listen to him call
Little dog don't have much at all
A puny body and a tiny dick
A little dog can make you sick
If you got the money you can go to the top
The female dog don't care what you got
As long as you can raise that
Little doggie face to a cold hearted pussy
You could have a taste
A taste of what the big dog got
A taste of what the big dog got
The little dog with the one hundred dollar spot
Can run his tongue over the hot in trot
Hot in trot
Run his tongue over the hot in trot
Money can do anything
Money can do anything
Money can do anything
Tell me what you want
My small dog, he want what I got
Wants to run his tongue over my hot spot
Pathetic little dog
Pathetic little dog
The little man follows his nose
Counts his fingers and his toes
He still got those
Pathetic little dog
Pathetic little dog
Following his nose
But it needs my money to buy
I'm an up while you're a down
I am an up while you're a down
The spring and the will follow me around
While you sniff your shit in the wind
Sniff your shit in the wind
Money can do anything
Money can do anything
Tell me what it is you want
Just tell me what it is you want
I'm an up while you're a down

Sight
Pale riders into the night
Galloping harder and faster
Through your dreaming wake
Walk towards the fire innate
Frost bitten soul below zero
Excitation
Are you remembering the sound?
Recall the shaking of the ground?
Pounding, pounding
No remorse
Lords of Summer set on course
Pushing, pushing
Horsemen ride
Lords of Summer undenied
At last the thawing has begun
Come trade your darkness for the sun
Melting the chill of winter's turn
So celebrate and let your fires burn
The lords of summer have returned
Straight
Light passes through
Penetrate
It's been a long lonely winter
Illumination
Bright
Bathe in the volume and light
Reanimated by fire
Transformation
Become the nexus of the sound
Become the shaking of the ground
Pounding, pounding
No remorse
Lords of Summer set on course
Pushing, pushing
Horsemen ride
Lords of Summer undenied
At last the thawing has begun
Come trade your darkness for the sun
Melting the chill of winter's turn
So celebrate and let your fires burn
The lords of summer have returned
Whoa... pounding, pounding
No remorse
Lords of Summer set on course
Whoa... pushing, pushing
Horsemen ride
The Lords of Summer undenied, undenied
At last the thawing has begun
Come trade your darkness for the sun
Melting the chill of winter's turn
So celebrate and let your fires burn
The Lords of Summer have returned

I've been mistreated, I've been abused.
I've been struck downhearted, baby, I've been confused
'cause I know, yes, I know I've been mistreated.
Since my baby left me I've been losing my mind, you know I have.
I've been lonely, I've been cold.
I've been looking for a woman to have and hold
'cause I know, yes, I know I've been mistreated.
Since my baby left me I've been losing, I've been losing,
I've been losing my mind, baby baby babe.
I've been mistreated, I've been abused.

I'm built like you are
I have a dress and a train
Your snake cold lips
Make a harsh straight line
That echoes through my brain
You're perfect
Let me lift a glass high
Let me follow in your footsteps
Let me follow in your sigh
Let me follow in your sigh
I'm a woman who likes men
But this is something else
I've never felt such stirrings
I feel like I
Was someone else
I wish you'd tie me up and beat me
Crush me like a kick
A bleeding strap across my back
Some blood that you could kiss
Oh kiss away, oh kiss away
I wish there was a strap of blood
That you could kiss away
I wish there was a strap of blood
That you could kiss away
Tie me with a scarf and jewels
Put a bloody gag to my teeth
I beg you to degrade me
Is there waste that I could eat
I am a secret lover
I am your little girl
Please spit into my mouth
I'm forever in your swirl
You're heartless and I love that
You have no use of me
But I open the sticks, sticky legs I bear
And then insert a fist, an arm
Some lost appendage
Please open me I beg
You are my goliath
You are my goliath
And I am mistress dread
Oh I am mistress dread
Oh I am mistress dread
Open and release me
I love you in my head
Oh kiss away kiss away
Kiss away kiss away
All I ask my baby
Kiss away
All I ask my baby
Kiss away

The cerebrum has suffered massive and irreparable damage
You can never know what has happened to him
If I have not been sure of this, I would not have permitted him to live
Where am I?
Father
What happened?
I need help
What is democracy?
What is democracy?
It got something to do with young men killing each other, I believe
When it's comes my turn, will you want me to go?
For democracy, any man would give his only begotten son
It is impossible for any severed individual to experience pain
Pleasure
Memory
Dreams or thought of any kind
This young man will be as unfeeling
As unthinking as the dead
Until the day he joins them
I don't know whether I'm alive or dreaming or dead or remembering
How can you tell what's a dream and what's real
When you can't even tell when you're awake and when you're asleep
Where am I?
I can't remember anything
Can't tell if this is true or dream
Deep down inside I feel to scream
This terrible silence stops with me
Now that the war is through with me
I'm waking up, I cannot see
That there's not much left of me
Nothing is real but pain now
Hold my breath as I wish for death
Oh please God, wake me
They kept my head and chopped off everything
Oh god, please make them hear me
They won't listen, they won't hear me
They got to wake me up I'll be like this for years
Hear me
Back in the womb it's much too real
In pumps life that I must feel
But can't look forward to reveal
Look to the time when I'll live
Fed through the tube that sticks in me
Just like a wartime novelty
Tied to machines that make me be
Cut this life off from me
Hold my breath as I wish for death
Oh please God, wake me
It's like a piece of me that keeps on living
It won't always be like this, will it?
I can't live like this!
I-I can't!
Please no
I can't! I can't!
Help me, help me, help me!
Mother where are ya?
Mommy, mother, I'm having a nightmare and I can't wake up
Now the world is gone I'm just one
Oh God help me
Hold my breath as I wish for death
Oh please God, help me
Me lying here like, like some freak in a carnival show
Here is the armless
Legless
Wonder of the twentieth century
Death has a dignity of its own
Father!
I need help
I'm in terrible trouble and I need help
Don't you remember when you were little?
How and you and Bill Harper use to string a wire between the two houses
So you could telegraph to each other
You'll remember the Morse code
Darkness
Imprisoning me
All that I see
Absolute horror
I cannot live
I cannot die
Trapped in myself
Body my holding cell
It's Morse code
For what?
S.O.S
Help
Landmine
Has taken my sight
Taken my speech
Taken my hearing
Taken my arms
Taken my legs
Taken my soul
Left me with life in Hell
What's he saying?
Said kill me
Over and over again
Kill me
Oh god, please make them hear me
Don't you have any message for him Arthur?
He's the product of your profession
Not mine
Kill me
I'm asking you to kill me
Thank you
Save me please
Father
Each man faces death by himself
Alone
Good-bye father
Inside me I'm screaming nobody pays any attention
If I had arms, I could kill myself
If I had legs, I could run away
If I had a voice, I could talk and be some kind of company for myself
How do I know they'll kill me?
I could yell for help, but nobody'd help me
I just got to do some kind of, see how I can go on like this
S.O.S. help me
S.O.S. help me
Keep the home fires burning
While our hearts are yearning

(Guitar Solo And Instrumental)The seas have parted
The end has started
The sky has turned to black
A killing spree through eternity
The Devil stabs you in the back
It's midnight now you must escape somehow
Torture is his leisure
Don't try to hide he'll make you subside
As he exchanges pain for pleasure, he's the hunter you're the game
Pain for pleasure, Satan is his name!
LOOK OUT!!!

See the ladies flashing. All there legs and lashes.
I've just got to find my way.
Well you see me crawling through the bushes with it open wide.
What you seeing girl?
Can't you believe that feeling, can't you believe it,
Can't you believe your eyes?
It's the real thing girl.
Got me feeling myself and reeling around,
Got me talking but feel like walking around.
Got me feeling myself and reeling a...
Got me talking but nothing's with me...

If I pump out blood in the sunshine
Oil on the wheel
That is blasted and busted away
A nail or a little piece of glass
A little piece of glass
A little piece of glass
Swarming like bees over the air
Off the pump off the thing
The blood that I'm pumping away
Like bees over the air
Off the pump
Off the thing
The blood that I'm pumping away
Off the pump
Off the thing
The blood that I'm pumping away
If I pump blood in the sunshine
And you wear a leather box with azaleas
And I pump more blood
And it seeps through my skin
Will you adore the river
The stream, the trickle
The tributary of my heart
As I pump more blood
And it seeps through my skin
Will you adore the river
The stream, the trickle
The tributary of my heart
If I'm pumping blood
Like a common state worker
If I waggle my ass like a dark prostitute
Would you think less of me
And my coagulating heart
Waggle my ass like a dark prostitute
Coagulating heart
Pumping blood
Would you top me off
Would you top me off as I deepen a curtsy
While you yell out, "mercy"
We grow apart
Would you rip and cut me
Use a knife on me
Be shocked at the boldness
The coldness of this little heart
Tied up in leather
Would you take the measure
Of the blood that I pump
In the manic confusion of love
Supreme violation
Supreme violation
"Oh, ah, ah, ah Jack I beseech you"
"Oh Jack I beseech you"
Supreme violation
Blood in the foyer
The bathroom
The tea room
The kitchen, with her knives splayed
I will swallow your sharpest cutter
Like a colored man's dick
Blood spurting from me
"Oh Jack, Jack I beseech…"
"Jack, I beseech you, I beseech…"
In the end it was an ordinary heart
"Oh Jack I beseech you"
As I scream out my pain
In the end it was an ordinary heart
In the end, in the end, in the end
It was an ordinary heart
"Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack I beseech you"
Supreme violation . . . Oh
"Jack, Jack, Jack I beseech you"
I call out your name
Blood in the foyer, the bathroom,
The tea room, the kitchen
And knives splayed
I swallow your sharpest cutter
Like a colored man's dick
Blood spurting from me
Blood spurting from me
"Oh Jack"
"Oh Jack, I beseech ya"
In the end it was an ordinary heart
In the end it was an ordinary heart
Pumping blood

Go, go, go
Beware of a place

I'll never return, how do you know?

The entrance to the fair

Where is your star?
Is it far, is it far, is it far?
When do we leave?
I believe, I believe, yes, I believe
In the heat and the rain
With whips and chains
To see him fly
So many die
We build a tower of stone
With our flesh and bone
Just to see him fly
But don't know why
Now where do we go?
Kill The King
Danger, danger the Queen's about to kill
Stranger, stranger and life about to spill
Oh no move me out of harm
I need a spell and a charm
Fly like the wind
I'm no pawn, so be gone, speed on and on
Kill the king
Tear him down
Kill the king
Strike him down
Power, power it happens every day
Power, devour all along the way
Oh no, move me out of harm
I need a spell and a charm
And fly like the wind
I'm no pawn, so be gone, speed on and on
Kill the king
Strike him down
Treason, treason, the spectre looms again
Treason, reason, the realm is safe and then
Oh no, move away from harm
I need a spell and a charm
Fly like the rainbow
I'm no pawn, so be gone, speed on and on
Kill the king
Tear him down
Kill the king
Yeah, take his crown
Oh, kill the king
Go take his crown
Yeah, yeah, kill the king

Alright!
We are scanning the scene in the city tonight
We are looking for you to start up a fight
There is an evil feeling in our brains
But it is nothing new, you know it drives us insane
Running on our way
Hiding, you will pay
Dying, one thousand deaths
Running on our way
Hiding, you will pay
Dying, one thousand deaths
Searching, seek and destroy
Searching, seek and destroy
Searching, seek and destroy
Searching, seek and destroy
There is no escape and that is for sure
This is the end we won't take any more
Say goodbye to the world you live in
You have always been taking, but now you're giving
Running on our way
Hiding, you will pay
Dying, one thousand deaths
Running on our way
Hiding, you will pay
Dying, one thousand deaths
Searching, seek and destroy
Searching, seek and destroy
Searching, seek and destroy
Searching, seek and destroy
Our brains are on fire with the feeling to kill
And it will not go away until our dreams are fulfilled
There is only one thing on our minds
Don't try running away, 'cause you're the one we will find
Running on our way
Hiding, you will pay
Dying, one thousand deaths
Running on our way
Hiding, you will pay
Dying, one thousand deaths
Searching, seek and destroy
Searching, seek and destroy
Searching, seek and destroy
Searching, seek and destroy

Reaching out for something you've got to feel
While clutching to what you had thought was real
Kicking at a dead horse pleases you
No way of showing your gratitude
So many things you don't want to do
What is it? What have you got to lose?
What the hell
What is you think you're gonna find?
Hypocrite
Boredom sets into the boring mind
(Struggle Within) It suits you fine
(Struggle Within) Your ruin
(Struggle Within) You seal your own coffin
(Struggle Within) The struggling within
Home is not a home it becomes a hell
Turning it into your prison cell
Advantages are taken, not handed out
While you struggle inside your hell
Reaching out
Grabbing for something you've got to feel
Closing in
The pressure upon you is so real
(Struggle Within) It suits you fine
(Struggle Within) Your ruin
(Struggle Within) You seal your own coffin
(Struggle Within) The struggling within
Struggle
(Solo)
Dhow!
Reaching out for something you've got to feel
While clutching to what you had thought was real
What the hell
What is you think you're gonna find?
Hypocrite
Boredom sets into the boring mind
(Struggle Within) It suits you fine
(Struggle Within) Your ruin
(Struggle Within) You seal your own coffin
(Struggle Within) The struggling within

Claustrophobic
Crawl out of this skin
Heart explosive
Reach in, pull that pin
Ain't no one gonna watch the road
Intention reckless
Ain't no one gonna slow the row
Invention reckless
So I cross that line
Pushing myself, daring myself
Scaring myself in the suicide lane
Deadly pulse
Pawing at the wheel
Death Magnetic
Pulling closer still
Ain't no one gonna hold the border
Insanely reckless
Ain't no one gonna give the order
Inanely reckless
So I cross that line
Pushing myself, daring myself
Scaring myself in the suicide lane
I scare myself
Crushing metal, ripping skin
Tossing body mannequin
Splatter blood, bleeding gas
Mangle flesh, snapping spine
Dripping bloody valentine
Shatter face, spitting glass
What makes me drift a little bit closer
Dead man takes the steering wheel
What makes me know it's time to cross over
Dead man takes the steering wheel
See through the skin the bones they all rattle
I start to see the end in me
Flesh falls away the bones they all shatter
I start to see the end in me
Claustrophobic
Crawl out of this skin
Heart explosive
Reach in, pull that pin
Every moment,
Flashed before my eyes
I wake up screaming
Life is undenied
Ain't no one gonna search the record
Intensely reckless
Ain't no one gonna get the message
Inherely reckless
I cross that line
Pushing myself, daring myself
Scaring myself in the suicide lane
Pushing myself in the suicide lane
Daring myself in the suicide lane
Pushing myself in the suicide lane
Daring myself in the suicide lane

The ballad of ?brain knight?
To the tune of ?lamb crops sing along? and ?the song that never
Ends?
The militant bunkers where
I imagine i?m in my lover?s bed
We swam naked ? we frolicked young and free
Glistening wet like a froggies leg on a paraplegic?s knee
I gazed into his eyes, what do i see
Jaundice, a disease menagerie
But though he?s got ? a figure of an aging sloth
His love ? pump can deliver a malicious wrath
David hasselhoff ? dressed mean, with boots to tease
Bend over, please now punish me
David hasselhoff ? tuck me in bed tonight
Appease me with your leathery face
Conscripted to fort dik
Showering with men from 3 to 6
We sung about ? leotards, fairies and naked gladiators
I dreamt i was peter pan in a frock telling captain hook to suck
My cock
It looks like i see your prong
I thought you were a ? naã¯ve bastard in a stupid talking car
But then i saw you in a ?baywatch? and thought you were the
Sexiest man by far
Done run away, i beg of thee
Ill show you athens ? style sodomy
We played ? grecko marines with our sted ? fast dicks
We clubbed our pricks like homeless kids and lathered our self
With garlic bread
My heart and bowel belongs to you
No one roots like you ? they cum too soon
Oh how ? soldiers love being gay
Unlike prison we don?t need soap to play
David hasselhoff ? my syphilis caused you internal rot
Your old and crusty, you cant even please
Fly back to germany, how ?bout writing a pop song or two
Hey davey boy, here?s a message for you ?
Fuck ? off ? you ? cunt!!

(Demo de "The Four Horsemen", com letra diferente.)
You imagine you were at my station
And you brought your motor to me
You're a burner yeah, a real motor car
You say you want your order filled
Made me shiver when I put it in
Pumping just won't do, you know, lucky for you
Who'd ever thought you'd be better
At turning a screw than me
I do it for my life
You made my drive shaft crank
You made my pistons bulge
You made my ball bearings melt from the heat
Oh yeah yeah
We were shifting this hard when we took off
Put tonight all four on the floor
When we hit top then you know it feels so slow
You say you want your order filled
Made me shiver when I put it in
Pumping just won't do, you know, lucky for you
Who'd ever thought you'd be better
At turning a screw than me
I do it for my life
You made my drive shaft crank
You made my pistons bulge
You made my ball bearings melt from the heat
Oh yeah yeah
I'm giving you my room service
And you know it's more than enough
When you spark my plug you know I'm in love
You imagine you were at my station
And you brought your motor to me
With all four on the floor I feel what's in store
Who'd ever thought you'd be better
At turning a screw than me
I do it for my life
You made my drive shaft crank

He lifteth me up and carries me away.

And you will find.
Find out for myself no more lies.

There is nowhere else i can run to,
She is wretched but she comforts me...
After everyone goes home,
She's always there for me !
And when the sun goes hellbound...
And the moon does resurrect the night !
I'll hide within her...
Not much good has come out of the light !
After everyone goes home,
And i'm left here on my own,
I will run straight to hell and back !
Straight to hell and back !
When they turn out all their lights,
And i'm left to brood at night,
Always return to hell and back !
Straight to hell and back !
Straight down, yeah !!!
A lonely light in a window
Just longing for some company !
Tragic, heartless and hateful
But there's nothing as willing as she !
And when the night has fallen
It falls hard and then it all begins !
When she starts her calling
I feel my darkness growing from within !
After everyone goes home,
And i'm left here on my own,
I will run straight to hell and back !
Straight to hell and back !
When they turn out all their lights,
And i'm left to brood at night,
Always return to hell and back !
Straight to hell and back !
Straight to hell and back !
I will run straight to hell and back !
I become two !
We become one !
Unbridled… unequaled… unholy… undone !
The path is cut deep !
The path is worn well !
I'll follow my footsteps to the warmth of hell !
The warmth of hell !
After everyone goes home,
And i'm left here on my own,
I will run straight to hell and back !
Straight to hell and back !
Straight to hell and back !
When they turn out all their lights,
And i'm left to brood at night,
Always return to hell and back !
Return to hell and back !
Straight to hell and back !
Straight to hell and back !
I will run straight to hell and back !
Straight down !

How could he know
This new dawn's light
Would change his life forever?
Set sail to sea
But pulled off course
By the light of golden treasure
Was he the one causing pain
With his careless dreaming?
Been afraid
Always afraid
Of the things he's feeling
He could just be gone
He would just sail on
He'll just sail on
How can I belong,
When I've got nowhere to go?
Shuffled streets of gold
How come it's got so cold?
How can I be lost?
When my ship was made to drift
And how can I blame you
When it's me I can't forgive?
His days drift on
Inside his fog
It's thick and suffocating
This sinking life
Outside it's hell
Inside, intoxicating
Ship's run aground
Like his life
The water's much too shallow
He goes down
Down with his ship
Sinking in the shadows
Now a castaway
They've all gone away
All gone away
How can I belong,
When I've got nowhere to go?
Shuffled streets of gold
How come it's got so cold?
How can I be lost?
When my ship was made to drift
And how can I blame you
When it's me I can't forgive?
Forgive me
Forgive me not
Forgive me
Forgive me not
Forgive me
Forgive me not
Forgive me
Forgive me
Why can't I forgive me?
Set sail to sea
But pulled off course
By the light of golden treasure
How could he know
This new dawn's light
Would change his life forever?
How can I belong,
When I've got nowhere to go?
Shuffled streets of gold
How come it's got so cold?
How can I be lost?
When my ship was made to drift
And how can I blame you
When it's me I can't forgive?

You see me now a veteran of a thousand psychic wars
Ive been living on the edge so long
Where the winds of limbo roar
And I'm young enough to look at
And far too old to see
All the scars are on the inside
I'm not sure if there's anything left of me
Don't let these shakes go on
Its time we had a break from it
Its time we had some leave
We've been living in the flames
We've been eating up our brains
Oh, please don't let theses shakes go on
You ask me why I'm weary, why I cant speak to you
You blame me for my silence
Say its time I changed and grew
But the wars still going on dear
And there's no end that I know
And I cant say if were ever...
I cant say if were ever gonna to be free
Don't let these shakes go on
Its time we had a break from it
Its time we had some leave
We've been living in the flames
We've been eating out our brains
Oh, please don't let theses shakes go on
You see me now a veteran of a thousand psychic wars
My energy's spent at last
And my armor is destroyed
I have used up all my weapons and I'm helpless and bereaved
Wounds are all I'm made of
Did I hear you say that this is victory?
Don't let these shakes go on
Its time we had a break from it
Send me to the rear
Where the tides of madness swell
And been sliding into hell
Oh, please don't let shakes go on
Don't let these shakes go on
Don't let these shakes go on

If you're leaving close the door.
I'm not expecting people anymore.
Hear me grieving, I'm lying on the floor.
Whether I'm drunk or dead I really ain't too sure.
I'm a blind man, I'm a blind man and my world is pale.
When a blind man cries, Lord, you know there ain't no sadder tale.
Had a friend once in a room,
had a good time but it ended much too soon.
In a cold month in that room
we found a reason for the things we had to do.
I'm a blind man, I'm a blind man, now my room is cold.
When a blind man cries, Lord, you know he feels it from his soul.
I'm a blind man, I'm a blind man and my world is pale.
When a blind man cries, Lord, you know there ain't no sadder tale.

She was a fast machine she kept her motor clean
She was the best damn woman that I ever seen
She had the sightless eyes telling me no lies
Knocking me out with those American thighs
Taking more than her share
Had me fighting for air
She told me to come, but I was already there
'Cause the walls start shaking
The earth was quaking
My mind was aching
And we were making it
And you shook me all night long
Yeah, you shook me all night long
Working double time on the seduction line
She's one of a kind, she's just mine, all mine
Wanted no applause it's just another course
Made a meal outta me
And come back for more
Had to cool me down to take another round
Now I'm back in the ring to take another swing
'Cause the walls were shaking the earth was quaking
My mind was aching
And we were making it
And you shook me all night long
Yeah, you shook me all night long
It knocked me out I said you
Shook me all night long
You had me shaking and you
Shook me all night long
Yeah, you shook me
When you took me
You really took me and you
Shook me all night long
Ah, you shook me all night long

I
I can't promise you that I won't let you down
And I
I can't promise you that I will be the only one around
When your hope falls down
But we're young
Open flowers in the windy fields of this war-torn world
And love
This city breathes the plague of loving things more than their creators
I ran away
I could not take the burden of both me and you
It was too fast
Casting love on me as if it were a spell I could not break
When it was a promise I could not make
But what if I was wrong?
But hold on to what you believe in the light
When the darkness has robbed you of all your sight
And now this land
Means less and less to me without you breathing through its trees
At every turn
The water runs away from me and the halo disappears
And the hole when you're not near
So what if I was wrong?
But hold on to what you believe in the light
When the darkness has robbed you of all your sight
So hold on to what you believed in the light

I turned up with my cap on back to front
Trying to be someone I saw on tv once
You were sitting by the window looking out for me
We were trying to find a way to say hi
That didn't seem strange but it didn't work out
Maybe that was just the way that it felt to me
It's taken me so long
Maybe I'm just too shy to say it
We could be more than friends
But maybe I'm just too shy
Walking home down the uxbridge road
Headphones on I got a cigarette rolled
I know I shouldn't light it cause
I haven't smoked one for weeks
Conversations running through my head
Till I get stuck on one thing
You should not have said but you said
And now it's all that I can thing about
It's taken me so long
Maybe I'm just too shy to say it
We could be more than friends
But maybe I'm just too shy
Let's go find a corner we can sit it
And talk about that film instead of us
Even though throughout it I was thinking
I was gonna say I love you afterwards
It's taken me so long
Maybe I'm just too shy to say it
We could be more than friends
But maybe I'm just too shy

Where do I turn to
When there's no choice to make?
And how do I presume
When there's so much at stake?
I was so sure of it all
But what if I need you
In my darkest hour?
And what if it turns out
There is no other?
If this is
Our last hope
We would see a sign, oh
We would see a sign
Well, I've been running
From the ashes we left
Forgiveness begs for itself
But how can I forget?
Well, there's a stain on it all?
But what if I need you
In my darkest hour?
And what if it turns out
There is no other?
We had it all
If this is
Our time now
We wanna see a sign, oh
We would see a sign
So give us a sign
I need some guiding light
Children of darkness, oh

Amazing Grace, how sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me
I once was lost but now am found
Was blind, but now I see
T'was Grace that taught my heart to fear
And Grace, my fears relieved
How precious did that Grace appear
The hour I first believed
Through many dangers, toils and snares
I have already come
'Tis Grace that brought me safe thus far
And Grace will lead me home
When we've been here ten thousand years
Bright shining as the Sun
We've no less days to sing God's praise
Than when we've first begun
Amazing Grace, how sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me
I once was lost but now am found
Was blind, but now I see

Well, they blew up the chickenman in philly last night, now they blew up his house too
Down on the boardwalk they're gettin' ready for a fight, gonna see what them racket boys can do
Now there's trouble busin' in from outta state and the d.a., can't get no relief
Gonna be a rumble out on the promenade and the gamblin' commissions hangin' on by the skin of its teeth
Everything dies, baby, that's a fact
But maybe everything that dies someday comes back...
Put your makeup on fix your hair up pretty and meet me tonight in atlantic city
Well i got a job and tried to put my money away
But i got in too deep and i could not pay
So i drew what i had from the central trust
And i bought us two tickets on that coast city bus
Everything dies, baby, that's a fact
But maybe everything that dies someday comes back...
Put your makeup on fix your hair up pretty and meet me tonight in atlantic city
Now our luck may have died and our love may be cold but with you forever i'll stay
We're goin' out where the sands turnin' to gold, so put on your stockin's cause the night is gettin' cold
And maybe everything dies, that's a fact
But maybe everything that dies someday comes back...
Now i been lookin' for a job but it's hard to find
Down here it's just winners and losers and don't get caught on the wrong side of that line
Well i'm tired of comin' out on the losin' end
So honey last night i met this guy and i'm gonna do a little favor for him
Well, i guess everything dies, baby, that's a fact
But maybe everything that dies someday comes back...
Put your makeup on, fix your hair up pretty and meet me tonight in atlantic city

How fickle my heart and how woozy my eyes
I struggle to find any truth in your lies
And now my heart stumbles on things I don't know
My weakness I feel I must finally show
Lend me your hand and we'll conquer them all
But lend me your heart and I'll just let you fall
Lend me your eyes I can change what you see
But your soul you must keep totally free
Heart, heart
In these bodies we will live
In these bodies we will die
Where you invest your love
You invest your life
In these bodies we will live
In these bodies we will die
Where you invest your love
You invest your life
Awake my soul

You were made to meet your maker

Sit
Enthroned in white grandeur
But tired
And shift
A wisp of wayward silver hair
From your eyes
I'd never seen you unkempt before
As you whispered: Darling, close the door
Well, how
Have I not made a note of every word
You ever said?
And time
Is not on our side
But I'll pretend that it's alright
She says the Lord has a plan
But admits it's pretty hard to understand
Before you leave
You must know you are beloved
And before you leave
Remember I was with you
Are you afraid?
How ever could you not be?
In this rosy light
This is strange
I feel a hand come through the mirror
Pointing at the light
Point at the light we never see
As you put your feathered arms over me
Before you leave
You must know you are beloved
And before you leave
Remember I was with you
And as you leave
I won't hold you back, beloved
We'll sit
And talk the stars down from the sky
And I'll not
Forget the chaos in your eyes, love
And as you leave
You must know you are beloved
And as you leave
I can see the wild has come for you
And as you leave
I won't hold you back, beloved
And as you leave
See my children playing at your feet

Older brother, restless soul, lie down
Lie for a while with your ear against the earth
And you'll hear your sister sleep talking
Say: Your hair is long but not long enough to reach
Home to me
But your beard
Someday might be
And she'll wake up in a cold sweat on the floor
Next to a family portrait drawn when you were four
And beside a jar of two cent coins that are no good no more
She'll lay it aside
Older father, weary soul, you'll drive
Out to the home you made on the mountainside
With that ugly, terrible thing
Those papers for divorce
And a lonely ring
A lonely ring
Sit on your porch
And pluck your strings
And you'll find somebody you can blame
And you'll follow the creek that runs out into the sea
And you'll find the peace of the Lord
Grandfather, weary soul, you'll fly
Over your life once more before you die
Since our grandma passed away
You've waited for forever and a day
Just to die
And someday soon
You will die
It was the only woman you ever loved
That got burnt by the sun too often when she was young
And the cancer spread and it ran into her body and her blood
And there's nothing you can do about it now

As the winter winds litter london with lonely hearts
Oh the warmth in your eyes swept me into your arms
Was it love or fear of the cold that led us through the night?
Over every kiss your beauty trumped my doubt
And my head told my heart
"let love grow"
But my heart told my head
"this time no
This time no"
We'll be washed and buried one day my girl
And the time we were given will be left for the world
The flesh that lived and loved will be eaten by plague
So let the memories be good for those who stay
And my head told my heart
"let love grow"
But my heart told my head
"this time no"
Yes, my heart told my head
"this time no
This time no"
Oh the shame that sent me off from the guard that i once loved
Was the same that sent me into your arms
Oh and pestilence is won when you are lost and i am gone
And no hope, no hope will overcome
And my head told my heart
"let love grow"
And my heart told my head
"this time no"
Yes, my heart told my head
"this time no
This time no"
And if your strife strikes at your sleep
Remember spring swaps snow for leaves
You'll be happy and wholesome again
When the city clears and sun ascends
And my head told my heart
"let love grow"
But my heart told my head
"this time no"
And my head told my heart
"let love grow"
But my heart told my head
"this time no
This time no"

Come, Thou Fount of every blessing
Tune my heart to sing Thy grace
Streams of mercy, never ceasing
Call for songs of loudest praise
Teach me some melodious sonnet
Sung by flaming tongues above
Praise the mount, I'm fixed upon it
Mount of Thy unchanging love
Here I raise my Ebenezer
Here there by Thy great help I've come
And I hope, by Thy good pleasure
Safely to arrive at home
Jesus sought me when a stranger
Wandering from the fold of God
He, to rescue me from danger
Interposed His precious blood
O to grace how great a debtor
Daily I'm constrained to be
Let that grace now, like a fetter
Bind my wandering heart to Thee
Prone to wander, Lord, I feel it
Prone to leave the God I love
Here's my heart, O take and seal it
Seal it for Thy courts above
Come, Thou Fount of every blessing
Tune my heart to sing Thy grace
Streams of mercy, never ceasing
Call for songs of loudest praise
Teach me some melodious sonnet
Sung by flaming tongues above
Praise the mount, I'm fixed upon it

You found a sweater on the ocean floor
They're gonna find it if you didnt close the door.
You and this model sit outside the side-
In a house on a street they wouldnt park on the night.
Dad was a risk taker.
His was a shoe maker.
You greatest hits 2006,
Little listmaker.
Caught in the melody,
You wait in the car.
You were born with ten fingers
And you're gonna use them all.
Interest in colors I discovered myself
If your art life is gritty
You'll be toasting my health
If an interest in coats,
You should be lining the walls.
When your birth right is interest
You could just screw it all.
Me and my cousins
And you and your cousins
Its a line that is always running.
Me and my cousins,
You and your cousins,
I can feel it coming
You can turn your back on the biddlewood (4x)
Me and my cousins and you and your cousins
Its a line thats always running
Me and my cousins and you and your cousins
I can feel it coming
Me and my cousins and you and your cousins
Its a line thats always running
Me and my cousins and you and your cousins

There to dwell in adamantine chains and penal fire
Who durst defy the Omnipotent to arms
Nine times the space that measures day and night
Rolling in the fiery gulf, confounded though immortal
But his doom reserved him to more wrath
For now the thought
Both of lost happiness and lasting pain, torments him
Round he throws his baleful eyes
That witnessed huge affliction and dismay
Mixed with obdurate pride and steadfast hate
At once, as far as Angels ken, he views
The dismal situation, waste and wild
A dungeon horrible, on all sides round
Regions of sorrow
Doleful shades, where peace and rest can never dwell
Hope never comes, that comes to all
But torture without end still urges
As one great furnace flamed
Yet from those flames no light
But rather darkness visible

Do not lie to us
Don't hide your eyes from us
I will take this offered cup
I will sit upon your floor
Tell your stories, tell of your pain
That's what I came here for
And your children come and go as you weep
But what have I?
If I have not love, I am a waste
My words are empty vessels
If I do nothing in this place
And we can scream into the shadows
And it's good that we can
But walk with me, I think we'll find a way
And walk with me, I think we'll find a way
But I'll meet you at the delta
Where the rivers run into the sea
And I'll meet you at the delta
What's behind, I can clearly see
But that beyond, that's beyond me
When it feels like nothing else matters
Will you put your arms around me?
When it feels like nothing else matters
Will you put your arms around me?
Does your love prefer the other?
Or does your love just makes you feel good?
Does my love prefer the other?
Or does my love just make me feel good?
When it's all just dust to dust
And that's how it will be
When it's all just nothingness
That means nothing to me
When it's all just dust to dust
And how it will be
When it's all just nothingness
That means nothing to me
Does my love prefer the other?
Or does my love just make me feel good?
Does my love prefer the other?
Or does my love just make me feel good?
When it feels like nothing else matters
Will you put your arms around me?
When it feels like nothing else matters

She was dark and bright headed in a dream
Earning from a rise down to her knees
With some kind of love
Tonight I can't tell if it's love or hate
How smooth they are and quick to interchange
Some kind of love
I'll be the devil in your eye, if it's what you need to hear
I'll be the devil in your eye, if it'll change the way you feel
Hope my breath, I know it's me you're gonna blame
But my mother blamed my mood, it's all the same
Some kind of love
Tonight I can't tell if it's love or hate
How smooth they are and quick to interchange
Just some kind of love
I'll be the devil in your eye, if it's what you need to hear
I'll be the devil in your eye, if it'll change the way you feel
That's some kind of love, what are you holding on to?
Some kind of love when you're scared you're gonna lose
Some kind of love, what are you holding on to?
Some kind of love when you're scared you're gonna lose
Some kind of love, what are you holding on to?
Some kind of love
Some kind of love when you're scared you're gonna lose
Some kind of love

I might be apart of this
Ripple on water from a lonesome drip
A fallen tree that witness me
I'm alone,
Him and me.
And then life it's self can not aspire
To have someone be so admired
I threw creation to my king
Have the silence broken by a whispered wind.
All of this can be broken
All of this can be broken
Hold your devil by his spoke
And spin him to the ground.
And root to root and tip to tip
I look at him my country gip
Let it up i own his fears
But someone brought you close to tears.
Many trains and many miles
Like you to me on this sunny isle
What of which you wish to speak
Have you come here to rescue me?
All of this can be broken
All of this can be broken
Hold your devil by his spoke
And spin him to the ground.
But the love of your life
Lives but lies no more
And where she lay
A flower grows.
The arms are fed
The babes have wed
And the backs have bled,
Keeping her in tow.
But i am keeper
And i hold your face away from light
I am yours 'till they come
I am yours 'till they come.
Eye to eye
Nose to nose
Ripping off eachothers clothes
In the most perculiar way.
Eye to eye
Nose to nose
Ripping off eachothers clothes
In the most perculiar way.

The young man stands on the edge of his porch
The days were short and the father was gone
There was no one in the town and no one in the field
This dusty barren land had given all it could yield
I've been kicked off my land at the age of sixteen
And I have no idea where else my heart could have been
I placed all my trust at the foot of this hill
And now I am sure my heart can never be still
So collect your courage and collect your horse
And pray you never feel this same kind of remorse
Seal my heart and break my pride
I've nowhere to stand and now nowhere to hide
Align my heart, my body, my mind
To face what I've done and do my time
Well you are my accuser, now look in my face
Your opression reeks of your greed and disgrace
So one man has and another has not
How can you love what it is you have got
When you took it all from the weak hands of the poor?
Liars and thieves you know not what is in store
There will come a time I will look in your eye
You will pray to the God that you've always denied
The I'll go out back and I'll get my gun
I'll say, "you haven't met me, I am the only son"
Seal my heart and break my pride
I've nowhere to stand and now nowhere to hide
Align my heart, my body, my mind
To face what I've done and do my time
Well yes sir, yes sir, yes it was me
I know what I've done, cause I know what I've seen
I went out back and I got my gun
I said, "you haven't met me, I am the only son".

Give me hope in silence
It's easier, it's kinder
And tell me not of heartbreak
It plagues my soul
It plagues my soul
We will meet back on this road
Nothing gained, truth be told
But I'm not the enemy
It isn't me, the enemy
But I came and I was nothing
Time will give us nothing
So why did you choose to lean on
A man you knew was falling?
Give me hope in silence
It's easier, it's kinder
And tell me not of heartbreak
It plagues my soul
It plagues my soul
And bury me beside you
I have no hope in solitude
And the world will follow
To the earth down below

Oh my
With downtown hair and high rise eyes
So naive to how the skyline lies
Must do nothing for your mind
I know I love you now
But will I love you then?
You can see it in my eyes
It doesn't really matter
Cos man, I'm cold
Man, I'm toothless
Man, my heart is so suddenly useless
What a fool you've landed
Oh oh oh, what a fool you call home
And you I'm amazed you held my gaze so long
With your down-home heart and skirt undone
Stood by the man that you call home
I know I love you now
But will I love you then?
You can see it in my eyes

For those below
Helpless she lies across the stairs
Haunting your days consuming your breath
There will be healing but don't force this girl to stand
As she's counting the ceilings with pale voice and trembling hands
You told me life was long but now that it's gone
You find yourself on top as the leader of the flock
Called to be wrong for those below
Whispered notes from the piano in the corner of the room
Hold your throat is that healing that your hearing in her tune
Wanting change but loving her just as she lies
Is the burden of the man who's build his life on love
You told me life was long but now that it's gone
You find yourself on top as the leader of the flock
Called to be wrong for those below
I be locked up in store
In the lavender ward
Cause my mind is just like her's
Just as broken just as crippled just as burned
And then I find myself on top as the leader of the flock
Called to be wrong for those below

I lit out from Reno
I was trailed by twenty hounds
Didn't get to sleep last night
'Till the morning came around
Set out runnin' but I take my time
A friend of the devil is a friend of mine
If I get home before daylight
I just might get some sleep tonight
Ran into the devil, babe, he loaned me twenty bills
I spent the night in Utah in a cave up in the hills
Set out runnin' but I take my time
A friend of the devil is a friend of mine
If I get home before daylight
I just might get some sleep tonight
I ran down to the levee but the devil caught me there
He took my twenty dollar bill and vanished in the air
Set out runnin' but I take my time
A friend of the devil is a friend of mine
If I get home before daylight
I just might get some sleep tonight
Got two reasons why I cry away each lonely night
The first one's named sweet Anne Marie
And she's my hearts delight
The second one is prison, babe, the sheriff's on my trail
And if he catches up with me, I'll spend my life in jail
Got a wife in Chino, babe, and one in Cherokee
The first one says she's got my child, but it don't look like me
Set out runnin' but I take my time
A friend of the devil is a friend of mine
If I get home before daylight
I just might get some sleep tonight
Set out runnin' but I take my time
A friend of the devil is a friend of mine
If I get home before daylight
I just might get some sleep tonight

Lay back, lay back, go to sleep my man
Wipe the blood from you face and your hands
Forgive yourself if you think that you can
Go to sleep, go to sleep my man
Twenty-one days lost at sea i fought
For twenty-two years non-stop i've talked
Through the desert, pissed drunk, and confused i walked
I spit a tooth in the palm of my hand
Lay back, lay back, go to sleep my man
Wipe the blood from you face and your hands
Forgive yourself if you think that you can
Go to sleep, go to sleep my man
Well the wind and the trees are ganging up on me
They sing my funeral song in harmony
Well i just want to walk home on the drunk i need
But they keep singing and singing and singing to me...
La, la, la, la, la, la (i hear them singing)
La, la, la, la, la, la (singing for me)
La, la, la, la, la, la (oh!)
Well i wish things were different, true, and deep
But everything that's so shallow is everything about me
If only i could just take all my money and leave
I hope the people on the ground will understand
I hope the people out there will understand
Lay back, lay back, go to sleep my man
Wipe the blood from you face and your hands
Forgive yourself if you think that you can
Go to sleep, go to sleep my man
La, la
Go to sleep, go to sleep my man
La, la
Go to sleep, go to sleep my man

There is no great thing, to stop and sing
Waiting for the rain
And this perfect pill, it's all too much
On the edge again
Don't look away
Couldn't help but note the coldest thing
In your precious face
Why do you always speak when you have no grace
In your precious face
But even in the dark I saw you were the only one alone
But these hot gates you spent your victory on
Though your swore you wouldn't do this anymore
And I can't be for you all of the things you want me to
But I will love you constantly
There's precious little else to me
And though we cry, we must stay alive
Another fragile edge, and a tender sound
And then you went aground
Near a duller blade, a promise out of sight
There's nothing here for you tonight
But even in the dark I saw you were the only one alone
But these hot gates you spent your victory on
Though your swore you wouldn't do this anymore
And I can't be for you all of the things you want me to
But I will love you constantly
There's precious little else to me
And though we cry, we must stay alive
Let my blood only run out when my world decides
There is no way out of your only life
So run on, so run!

And blame god for looking too old
Can you find all that you stand for?
Has been replaced with mountains of gold
You can untrain yourself to notice
To feel pain and swallow fear
But can you stay up for the weekend
To next year
God i can't do this anymore
Oh i'll be laid down on the floor
As many feet walk through the door
I'm not alone

Living on the road my friend
Was gonna keep you free and clean
Now you wear your skin like iron
Your breath's as hard as kerosene
You weren't your mama's only boy
But her favorite one it seems
She began to cry when you said goodbye
And sank into your dreams
Pancho was a bandit boys
His horse was fast as polished steel
Wore his gun outside his pants
For all the honest world to feel
Pancho met his match you know
On the deserts down in mexico
Nobody heard his dying words
That's the way it goes
All the federales say
They could have had him any day
They only let him hang around
Out of kindness i suppose
Lefty he can't sing the blues
All night long like he used to
The dust that pancho bit down south
Ended up in lefty's mouth
The day they laid poor pancho low
Lefty split for ohio
Where he got the bread to go
There ain't nobody knows
All the federales say
They could have had him any day
They only let him slip away
Out of kindness i suppose
The poets tell how pancho fell
Lefty's livin' in a cheap hotel
The desert's quiet and cleveland's cold
So the story ends we're told
Pancho needs your prayers it's true,
But save a few for lefty too
He just did what he had to do
Now he's growing old
A few gray federales say
They could have had him any day
They only let him go so wrong
Out of kindness i suppose

I came here without a choice
I'm sorry I could never thank you
For saving me more trouble
I didn't want any trouble
If you were given one more chance
Would you bring me back to life?
Bring me back into the light
Into the light?
And let it shine on
Let it shine on us
And if I say I love you
Well, then I love you
And if I say I love you
Well, then I love you
The innocence in your face
Bled out without a trace
You've won without an enemy
You're ill without a remedy
As night bleeds into night
And I know I came off better than you
It doesn't mean that I feel better
It doesn't mean that I feel better

Are they cleaner than mine?
Show me your face
Did you cross the line?
Show me your eyes
Are they drier than mine?
Your soul survives
But peace you'll never find

Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
I'm begging of you, please don't take my man
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
Please don't take him just because you can
Your beauty is beyond compare
With flaming locks of auburn hair
With ivory skin and eyes of emerald green
Your smile is like a breath of spring
Your voice is soft like summer rain
And I cannot compete with you, Jolene
He talks about you in his sleep
And there's nothing I can do to keep
From crying when he calls your name, Jolene
And I can easily understand
How you could easily take my man
But you don't know what he means to me, Jolene
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
I'm begging of you, please don't take my man
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
Please don't take him just because you can
You could have your choice of men
But I could never love again
He's the only one for me, Jolene
I had to have this talk with you
My happiness depends on you
And whatever you decide to do, Jolene
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
I'm begging of you, please don't take my man
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
Please don't take him even though you can
Jolene, Jolene

Tell my thoughts to resign
And lift you from my mind
I'm not ready I'm not strong enough
To cradle the weight of your love
Just take a minute take a breath
Lay down your head on my sunken chest
I saw a flicker then just smoke
But as you left I was calling your name at the night
I thought we were done
And young love would keep us young
I thought we were done
And young love would keep us young
I thought we fell to the ground
I see you whimper with no sound
Open my mouth to breathe some words of peace
But the silence gives nothing back to me
So I'll be a shadow of the flame
I lent down to kiss you then erased my name
And I'll be a whisper on the wind
My hands are shaking from holding so tight for so long
The flame burnt out in our empty hands
But now I see it's got nothing to do
It's got nothing to do with you
(Why do I keep falling) I thought we were done
(Why do I keep falling) And young love would keep us young

Though i may speak
Some tongue of old
Or even spit out some holy word
I have no strength with which to speak
When you sit me down and see i’m weak
We will run and scream
You will dance with me
We’ll fulfill our dreams, and we’ll be free
We will run and scream
You will dance with me
We’ll fulfill our dreams, and we’ll be free
We will be who we are
And they’ll heal our scars
Sadness will be far away
So i have done wrong
To put me right
My judgement burned in the black of night
Then i give less than i take
It is my fault, my own mistake
We will run and scream
You will dance with me
We’ll fulfill our dreams, and we’ll be free
We will be who we are
And they’ll heal our scars
Sadness will be far away

Come sing to me a song

And a long time to be gone
I'd rather be in some dark holler
Where the sun don't never shine

And to know you'll never be mine
Little birdie, little birdie

It's because my own true lover
Is waiting in the sky
Little birdie, little birdie

And i won't hear you cry when i'm gone
I won't know if i'm doing you wrong, i never know if i'm doing you wrong
A constant reminder of where i can find her
Why am i blown away
Its all that i'm asking for, lover i've lost
My love don't fade away
Watch the world tear us apart
A stoic mind and a bleeding heart
You never see my bleeding heart
And your lights always shinning on
But i've been traveling oh so long
Well i've been traveling oh so long
A constant reminder of where i can find her
Why am i blown away
It's all that i'm asking for, lover i've lost
My love don't fade away
It goes without saying
But in love you just can't get out the way
Oh, but the other would stay
A constant reminder of where i can find her

It's all that i'm asking for, lover i've lost

And i was blown away

I was born a black boy
My name is emmett till
I walked this earth for 14 years
And one night i was killed
For speaking to a woman
Whose skin was white as dough
That's a sin in mississippi
But how was i to know?
I'd come down from chicago
To visit with my kin
Up there i was a cheeky kid
I guess i'd always been
But the harm they put upon me
Was too hard for what i'd done
For i was just a black boy
And never hurt no one
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
They took me from my uncle's house
Mose wright was his name.
He'd later stand and, without hesitation,
Point the blame
At the ones who beat and cut me
And shot me with a gun
And threw me in the river
Like i was trash when they were done
I was sent back to my mother,
At least what was left of me,
She kept my casket open
For the whole wide world to see
The awful desecration
And the evidence of hate
You could not recognize me
The mutilation was so great
There came a cry for justice
To be finally fulfilled
All because of me, a black boy
My name is emmett till
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh, but i'd have rather lived
'till i was too old to die young
Not miss all i left behind
And all that might have come
Summer clouds above my head
The grass beneath my feet
The warmth of a good woman
Her kisses soft and sweet
Perhaps to be a father
With a black boy of my own
Watch him grow into a kinder world
Than i had known
Where no child would be murdered
For the colour of his skin
And love would be the only thing
Inside the hearts of men
They say the horror of that night
Is haunting heaven still
Where i am one more black boy
My name is emmett till

I came home
Like a stone
And I fell heavy into your arms
These days of dust
Which we've known
Will blow away with this new sun
And I'll kneel down
Wait for now
And I'll kneel down
Wait for now
So break my step
And relent
You forgave and I won't forget
Know what we've seen
And him with less
Now in some way
Shake the excess
And I'll kneel down
Wait for now
And I'll kneel down
Know my ground
Now I'll be bold
As well as strong
Use my head alongside my heart
So take my flesh
And fix my eyes
That tethered mind free from the lies
And I'll kneel down
Wait for now
And I'll kneel down
Know my ground
And I'll kneel down
Wait for now
Raise my hands
Paint my spirit gold
And bow my head
Keep my heart slow
And raise my hands
Paint my spirit gold
And bow my head
Keep my heart slow

In the silver light
I just made out
Your silhouette
Through the quickening haze
So brand it on my mind
So I don't forget
Let it shine
On my wandering eyes
Ooh, your love endures
Ooh, I have faith for the rest
I'm blinded by the lights
Of October skies
These postcard memories
Evade my eyes
And in the valley I'm free
But in the hills I soar
'Til your silhouette
Is gone once more
Ooh, your love endures
Ooh, I have hope once more
The fear of what's to come
Has been crippling me
So to your silhouette
I turn once more
So brand it on my mind
So I won't forget
Let it shine, let it shine
By my wandering eyes
Oh, let it shine, let it shine
By my wandering eyes
Ooh, your love endures
Ooh, I have hope once more

Loneliness and all, I was stuck to the spot without a friend
Alone again, and I hunger and I thirst for some shiver
For some whispered words and the promise to come
And you saw me low,
Alone again
Didn't they say that only love will win in the end?
I didn't fool me but I failed you, in short
Made a fool out of you, the younger heart
And I rage, and I rage, but perhaps I will come of age
And be ready for you
And you saw me low,
Alone again
Didn't they say that only love will win in the end?
Didn't they say that only love will win in the end?
And you saw me low,

If I could tell you no
I thought it best you didn't know
Don't see it coming
The darkness visible
But when its eyes fix mine
It's silver and it's stone

The gathering storm
And when I feel that darkness
Is a heartbeat away
And I don't know how to fight it
It's a heartbeat away
And now you don't know me like this
It's a heartbeat away
And I don't know how to hide it
It's a heartbeat away

Soaked in light
I picture you
And in you I have no doubt
When the chaos calls me out
And it feels like there is nothing I can do
I'll picture you
And the night falls fast
I know it's heavy on the skin
Will it be ever thus?
Barely visible
But when your eyes fix mine
Embracing your denial
Well, I hold my breath
Through the waste and the wild
But when I feel it rising
And it's a heartbeat away
And I don't know how to fight it
It's a heartbeat away
And now you don't know me like this

Fold your hair behind your ears
Roll your questions across the floor
I know we've been here for years
But at least we've been here before
My mind finds peace in the shade of your attention
But gets tangled by the night
I didn't know what I was thinking, but I know we’ll be alright
And I will surround you
With a love too deep for words
Hold you from the world and its curse
So long as I have breath in my lungs
Long as there's a song to be sung
I will be yours and you will be mine
Ever our lives entwined
My rose of Sharon
My rose of Sharon
Come crashing in like a wildfire, I'm left in awe of you
Every time I close the door, I’m left wanting more of you
I wish I had some grand sense of occasion
But I just smile and turn away
I hope you know by now I don't know another way
When it's said and done
I'm yours forever
Like I said, I'm done
I'm yours forever
I will surround you
With a love too deep for words
Hold you from the world and its curse
So long as I have breath in my lungs
Long as there's a song to be sung

Slip away in the night
Waiting patient for the sun to rise

Slip away in the night

Come and suffer here

A fair irish girl has kept my eyes still
And if she doesn't know i love her she soon enough will
'cause i'll head to heathrow with a rose in my hand
And i'll run it to her as soon as i land
So much to say and so much to share
For one-night lovers or a lifelong pair
Susie susie lead me home
My misguided feet have driven me wrong
I'm a long lost lover and i stand alone
So susie susie lead me home
If it stole you eyes
Would you ask them back from me?
If i wrote you this song
Would you dance to it down grafton street?
If whisked you away
Would you weigh light in my arms?
When we leave this world
Will our love linger on?
Susie susie lead me home
My misguided feet have driven me wrong
I'm a long lost lover and i stand alone
So susie susie lead me home
And i went to dublin to look for you suze
It wasn't long before i found myself alone at o'donoghue's
Another misadventure by my misguided feet
I just sat and i hummed this tune as my toes tapped the beat
Susie susie lead me home
My misguided feet have driven me wrong
I'm a long lost lover and i stand alone
So susie susie lead me home

Bite chunks out of me
You're a shark and I'm swimming
My heart still thumps as I bleed
And all your friends come sniffing
Triangles are my favourite shape
Three points where two lines meet
Toe to toe, back to back, let's go
My love it's very late
'Til morning comes, mmmm
Let's tessellate.
Go alone my flower
And keep my whole lovely you
Wild green stones alone my lover
And keep us on my heart
Three guns and one goes off
One's empty, one's not quick enough
One burn, one red, one grin
Search the graves while the camera spins
Chunks of you will sink down to the seals
Blubber rich the in mourning
They'll nosh you up, yes they'll nosh the love away, but it's fair to say
You will still haunt me
Triangles are my favourite shape
Three points where two lines meet
Toe to toe, back to back, let's go
My love it's very late
'Til morning comes, mmmm
Let's tessellate.

She stole my heart and made me sing
She tore me limb from limb
I did not think that I could love
Or be loved that way again
How glad I was to be myself
And use my heart once more
How glad I was to be a man
That loved that girl that I adore
Well my eyes shall see light again
And my heart shall bleed right again

The brightest lights cast the darkest shadows
And that’s where i’ll be found
For what’s hiding by the morning
Will be chased by daylight’s hounds
Oh the dawn light sweeps all the shadows clean
Of what has gathered in the night
Hang the villains and the crooks, high on butchers hooks
As they run from the sun in fright
Oh the moonlight shadows are fleeting and scattered
Where memories and prophecies are slain
Only the moment you’re in can delight in sin
So forget your regrets and pains
The brightest lights cast the darkest shadows
And that’s where i’ll be found
For what’s hiding by the morning
Will be chased by daylight’s hounds
Well the twilight shivers as darkness is risen
Cold ash poured over the sun
For the sun to rise again, he must go through hell
To see what the darkness has done
The depraved are tamed, caught in pleasures chains
Are willingly surrendering
There’s a song to your soul while you bow to gold
This song the angels sing
The brightest lights cast the darkest shadows
And that’s where i’ll be found
For what’s hiding by the morning
Will be chased by daylight’s hounds
The brightest lights cast the darkest shadows
And that’s where i’ll be found
For what’s hiding by the morning
Will be chased by daylight’s hounds
The brightest lights cast the darkest shadows
And that’s where i’ll be found
For what’s hiding by the morning
Will be chased by daylight’s hounds

Listen to the wind blow
Watch the sun rise
Run in the shadows
Damn your love
Damn your lies
And if
You don't love me now
You will never love me again
I can still hear you saying
You would never break the chain.
List to the wind blow
Down comes the night
Run in the shadows
Damn your love
Damn your lies
Break the silence
Damn the dark
Damn the light
And if
You don't love me now
You will never love me again

Give me hope in silence
It's easier, it's kinder
Tell me not of heartbreak
It plagues my soul, it plagues my soul
We will meet back on this road
Nothing gained, truth be told
But I'm not the enemy
It isn't me the enemy
But I came and I was nothing
And time will give us nothing
So why did you choose to lean on
A man you knew was falling?
Give me hope in silence
It's easier, it's kinder
Tell me not of heartbreak
It plagues my soul, it plagues my soul
And burry me beside you
I have no hope in solitude
And the world will follow
To the earth down below
But I came and I was nothing
And time will give us nothing
So why did you choose to lean on

I pulled into Nazareth, was feelin' about half past dead;
I just need find a place where I can rest my head.
"Hey, mister, will you tell me where a man might find a bed?"
He just grinned and shook my hand, and "No!", was all he said.
Take a load off Fanny, take a load for free
Take a load off Fanny, and (and)
Put the load right on me.
I picked up my bag, I went lookin' for a place to hide
When I saw Carmen and the Devil walkin' side by side.
I said, "Hey, Carmen, come on, let's go downtown."
She said, "I got to go, but my friend can stick around."
Take a load off Fanny, take a load for free
Take a load off Fanny, and (and)
You put the load on me.
Go down, Miss Moses, there's nothin' you can say
It's just ol' Luke, and Luke is waitin' on the Judgement Day.
"Well, Luke, my friend, what about young Anna Lee?"
He said, "Do me a favour, son, woncha stay an' keep Anna Lee company?"
Take a load off Fanny, take a load for free
Take a load off Fanny, and (and)
You put the load on me
Crazy Chester followed me, and he caught me in the fog.
He said, "I'll fix your rack, if you'll take Jack, my dog."
I said, "Wait a minute, Chester, you know I'm a peaceful man."
He said, "That's okay, boy, won't you feed him when you can."

We saw birth and death
Can't we be still?
What makes you kind?
From where comes your sparkling mind?
Was it under the earth?
Tied up in a knot
Which I forgot you were ever there?
Do not be afraid
Do not be afraid
What’s that I see?
I think it's the wild
Puts the fear of God in me
It was ever thus
Up from the dust
Inconceivable love
What's that I see?
I think it’s the wild
Puts the fear of God in me

On a spaceship somewhere sailing across an empty sea
This time tomorrow what will we know
Well we still be here watching an in-flight movie show
I'll leave the sun behind me and watch the clouds as they sadly pass me by
Seven miles below ma i can see the world and it ain't so big at all
This time tomorrow what will we see
Field full of houses, endless rows of crowded streets
I don't where i'm going, i don't want to see
I feel the world below me looking up at me
Leave the sun behind me, and watch the clouds as they sadly pass me by
And i'm in perpetual motion and the world below doesn't matter much to me
This time tomorrow where will we be
On a spaceship somewhere sailing across any empty sea
This time tomorrow, this time tomorrow

Spare me your judgements and spare me your dreams
Cause recently mine have been tearing my seams
I sit alone in this winter clarity which clouds my mind
Alone in the wind and the rain you left me
It's getting dark darling, too dark to see
And I'm on my knees, and your faith in shreds, it seems
Corrupted by the simple sniff of riches blown
I know you have felt much more love than you've shown
And I'm on my knees and the water creeps to my chest
But plant your hope with good seeds
Don't cover yourself with thistle and weeds
Rain down, rain down on me
Look over your hills and be still
The sky above us shoots to kill
Rain down, rain down on me
But I will hold on
I will hold on hope
I begged you to hear me, there's more than flesh and bones
Let the dead bury the dead, they will come out in droves
But take the spade from my hands and fill in the holes you've made
But plant your hope with good seeds
Don't cover yourself with thistle and weeds
Rain down, rain down on me

I don’t want to leave this train
A world of weights with its fames
Got me thinkin’ of the times
We were runnin’ down the lines
And i got sweet dreams forever
On a train in the sky
California to new orleans
And all that country in between
New friends from old lives playin’ through the night
Singing sweet dreams forever on a train in the sky.
Oooh can you hear it, that whistle blow
And oooh can you feel it take your load
Music and laughter, hearing people sing
We got sweet dreams forever,
Oh let it ring, let it ring
Sweet dreams forever on a train in the sky.
Well the end came softly in the night
A golden circle shown its light
Though we say goodbye
May these friendships never die
We’ll have sweet dreams forever on a train the sky.
We’ll have sweet dreams forever on a train in the sky, sky, sky.
Forever on a train in the sky.
Train in the sky.

I feel as if i've been where you have been
The snow had piled up knee-high in the street
Apart, apart
And dancing on
The wanderer
The squanderer
Our son was dying and we could hardly eat
They dragged me by the ankles through the street (two hearts)
They passed me round them like a piece of meat
His hairy hands
His falling fists
His dancing cock
Down by his knees
I've seen my children turn away from me
O, do you want my bones between your teeth?
They pulled me half-alive out of the sea
Apart, apart
And dancing on
Impossible
Impossible
I feel as if i've been where you have been
I feel as if i've been where you have been

Just give me a second darling
To clear my head
Just put down those scissors baby, on this single bed
The sand in the hourglass is running low
I came through thunder, the cold wind
The rain, and the snow
To find you awake by your windowsill
A sight for sore eyes and a view to kill
I broke down in horror at you standing there
The glow from the moon
Shone through cracks in your hair.
I shouted with passion,
"I love you so much"
But feeling my skin, it was cold to the touch.
You whispered, "Where are you?"
I questioned your doubt
But soon realized, you were talking to God now.
But, you have blood on your hands
And I know it's mine
I just need more time
So get off your low and let's dance like we used to
And there's a light in the distance
Waiting for me, and I will wait for you
So get off your low and let's kiss like we used to
I looked in the mirror
Bust something was wrong.
I saw you behind but my reflection was gone.
There was smoke in the fireplace
As white as the snow.
A voice beckoned gently,
"Now it's time to go"
A requiem played as you begged for forgiveness
"Don't touch me," I screamed,
"I've got unfinished business!"
But, you've got blood on your hands
And I know it's mine
I just need more time
So get off your low and let's dance like we used to
And there's a light in the distance
Waiting for me, and I will wait for you
So get off your low and let's kiss like we used to
Cause, you've got blood on your hands
And I know it's mine
I just need more time
So get off your low and let's dance like we used to
And there's a light in the distance
Waiting for me, and I will wait for you
So get off your low and let's kiss like we used to

I came home
Like a stone
And I fell heavy into your arms
These days of dust
which we've known
will blow away with this new sun
And I'll kneel down, wait for now
And I'll kneel down, wait for now
So break my step
And relent
Well you forgave
And I won't forget
Know what we've seen
And him with less
Know in some way
Shake the excess
And I'll kneel down, wait for now
And I'll kneel down, know my ground
Now I'll be bold, as well as strong
And use my head alongside my heart
So take my flesh
And fix my eyes
And tear the night free from the lies
And I'll kneel down, wait for now
And I'll kneel down, know my ground
I'll kneel down, wait for now
Raise my hands
Paint my spirit gold
Bow my head
Keep my heart slow
Raise my hands
Paint my spirit gold
Bow my head
Keep my heart slow

Headed down south to the land of the pines
I'm thumbin' my way into north caroline
Starin' up the road
And pray to god i see headlights
I made it down the coast in seventeen hours
Pickin' me a bouquet of dogwood flowers
And i'm a hopin' for raleigh
I can see my baby tonight
So rock me mama like a wagon wheel
Rock me mama anyway you feel
Hey mama rock me
Rock me mama like the wind and the rain
Rock me mama like a south-bound train
Hey mama rock me
Runnin' from the cold up in new england
I was born to be a fiddler in an old-time string band
My baby plays the guitar
I pick a banjo now
Oh, the north country winters keep a gettin' me now
Lost my money playin' poker so i had to up and leave
But i ain't a turnin' back
To livin' that old life no more
Walkin' to the south out of roanoke
I caught a trucker out of philly
Had a nice long toke
But he's a headed west from the cumberland gap
To johnson city, tennessee
And i gotta get a move on fit for the sun
I hear my baby callin' my name
And i know that she's the only one
And if i die in raleigh
At least i will die free

There were moments of dreams i was offered to save
I live less like a workhorse, more like a slave
I thought that one quick moment that was noble or brace
Would be worth the most of my life.
So i pointed my fingers, and shout a few quotes i knew
As if something that's written should be taken as true
But every path i have taken and conclusion i drew
Would put truth back under the knife.
And now the only piece of advice that continues to help:
Is anyone that's making anything new only breaks something else.
When my time comes,
Ohhhhh, oh oh oh.
When my times comes,
Ohhhhh, oh oh oh.
So i took what i wanted and put it out of my reach
I wanted to pay for my successes with all my defeats,
And if heaven was all that was promised to me
Why don't i pray for death?
And now it seems like the unraveling has started too soon,
Now i'm sleeping in hallways and i'm drinking perfume
And i'm speaking to mirrors and i'm howling at moons
While the worst and the worst that it gets.
Oh you can judge all the world on the sparkle that you think it lacks.
Yes you can stare into the abyss, but it's staring right back.
When my time comes,
Ohhhhh, oh oh oh.

Did you give it to a doctor to dissect apart
I'm not joking anymore, girl
Where is... my heart!
Oh where is my heart, girl
Where is my heart
Did you throw it in a blender or throw it beneath a car
Did you give it to a doctor to dissect apart
I'm not joking anymore, girl
Where is my heart!
Oh where are my ears, girl
Where are my ears
Did you go ahead and shave them off when you shaved off my beard
You know that without them my head looks kinda weird
I'm not joking anymore, girl
Where are my ears
Oh where is my heart, girl
Where is my heart
Did you throw it in a blender or throw it beneath a car
Did you give it to a doctor to dissect apart
I'm not joking anymore, girl
Where is my heart
Oh where is my tongue, girl
Where is my tongue
Did you go ahead and suck it out when you sucked out my lungs
You know that without it my song cannot be sung
I'm not joking anymore, girl
Where is my tongue
Beers, browns, and banjos
Is that all I need
I looked up at the sky and I got down on my knees
Oh lord for Christmas wont you find me a wife
I will play her my banjo and she'll give me... a life!
Oh Where is my heart, girl
Where is my heart
Did you throw it in a blender or throw it beneath a car
Did you give it to a doctor to dissect apart
I'm not joking anymore, girl
Where is... my heart!

What would you think if I sang out of tune?
Would you stand up and walk out on me?
Lend me your ears and I'll sing you a song,
I'll try not to sing out of key.
I get by with a little help from my friends,
I get high with a little help from my friends,
Gonna try with a little help from my friends.
What do I do when my love is away?
(Does it worry you to be alone?)
How do I feel by the end of the day?
(Are you sad because you're on your own?)
I get by with a little help from my friends,
I get high with a little help from my friends,
Gonna try with a little help from my friends
Do you need anybody?
I need someone to love.
Could it be anybody?
Oh, I need someone to love.
I get by with a little help from my friends,
I get high with a little help from my friends,
Gonna try with a little help from my friends.
Would you believe in a love at first sight?
Yes I'm certain that it happens all the time.
What do you see when you turn out the light?
I can't tell you, but I know it's mine.
I get by with a little help from my friends,
I get high with a little help from my friends,
Gonna try with a little help from my friends.
Do you need anybody?
I don't know,

Oh, I need someone to love.

You don't wanna turn away this time
Then why don't you take a different line
Don't have to be cruel to be kind
You don't have to lose your mind
You don't wanna suffer for your art
You don't wanna vivisect your heart
And then if you're falling apart
You're probably trying too hard
In the dawning light I found you breathless
But I won't deny I love you helpless
[Baaba Maal in Pulaar language]
You don't wanna say what you don't mean
You still want to paint a figure scene
You hide in the wings with a lamp
And cast the shadows on a screen
You don't wanna sing what you can say
Well that's quite a hard game to play
But I've fallen for your ways
In spite of myself I don't want you to change
But in the dawning light I found you breathless
But I won't deny I love you helpless
Wona
Wona
Wona
Wona
In the dawning light I found you breathless
But I won't deny I love you helpless
And I will be yours (wona)
And you will be mine (wona)
And I will be yours (wona)
And you will be mine (wona)

The things i don't want to do, i just keep doing
The things i want to do, i can't do
What a wretched man i am becoming
What a wretched man i have become
Who will save me
From this body of death that is looming
From this funeral parlor i keep on seeing
In the corner of my eye while pointing my gun
In the corner of my mind while ignoring the sun
It's coming for me, it's coming for me
But what you ask just cannot be done
A spineless heart is what i've become
The weight on my back is just too heavy
A holy life just wasn't for me
Keep smearing my heart, all over my sleeve
Someone comes and wipes it off and takes it from me
What's left is hardly mine but just a shadow of myself
For i find that i'm entwined, in a battle over my health
And i can't win, and i can't win
But what you ask just cannot be done
A weight heart is what i've become
The sweat on my back was just too heavy
A holy life just wasn't for me, a holy life just wasn't for me
But what you ask just cannot be done
A spineless heart is what i've become
The weight on my back was just too heavy
You say a holy life still waits for me
You say a holy life still waits for me

Kate wasn't in to moderation
That's what led to her frustration
With the state of her crumbling heart
She'd say "i'm not a girl for temperance",
Though i know it's at my heart's expense
But a downward spiral has to have a rock bottom.
She painted the walls with blue and green
She'd sing about her lovers and dreams and
Explain her hopeless desperation
Take off your shoes unravel your blues
This place is full of beggars and choosers
But the consequence of her liberty is bad
But my heart wants to go one way my mind don't agree
Cause they, they have fallen out recently
"know thy self" she said as she guided me round
The land of the dead
Introducing her friend stuck in the same mess
Ships might be built for sailing, my love, an easel's made for painting
But you ain't no sailor and i'll never be camera shy
My hear wants to go one way my mind don't agree
Cause they, they have fallen out recently
Well she said
"will i praise again? oh will i praise again?"
Cause my heart wants to go on where my mind don't agree
And they, they have fallen out recently
Well she said,
"oh will i praise again?"
"oh will i praise again?"
"will i, will i sing again?"
"will i, praise again?"

Ooh, I'll be laughing when you're crying
Push me and you lose
Ooh, I'll be dancing when you're dying
Your paid dues
You got me out of indecision
You can slash me out of fear
Good intentions get me nowhere
It's always nothing, all your love
Tell me about your overview
And I'll, try to show you how it looks from here
I ain't goin' down
Ain't goin' down
Ain't goin' down no more
I ain't goin' down
Ain't goin' down
Ain't goin' down no more
No, no, no
No!
I can see your true colors
I see red
When you hide all of your lovers under the bed
Instigate a simple life
And who's to say what's black or white?
Just because, you're curious, I've earned another brought me near
Through all the dreams that I could use
Now I know there's nothing I could do
For you!
Ain't goin' down
Ain't goin' down
Ain't goin' down no more
I ain't goin' down

Feel like i wanna smack somebody
Turn around and bitch slap somebody (bitch)
But i ain't goin' out bro (no, no, no)
I ain't givin' into it (no, no, no)
Anxieties bash my mind in
Terrorizing my soul like bin laden
But i ain't fallin' down bro (no, no, no)
I won't lose control bro (no, no, no)
Shackle and chained
My soul feels stained
I can't explain got an ich on my brain
Lately my whole aim is to maintain
And regain control of my mainframe
My bloods boiling its beatin' out propaine
My train of thoughts more like a runaway train
I'm in a fast car drivin' in a fast lane
In the rain and i'm might just hydroplaine
I don't fear none of my enemies
And i don't fear bullets from oozies
I've been dealing with something thats worse than these
That'll make you fall to your knees and thats the
The anxiety the sane and the insane rivalry
Paranoias brought me to my knees
Lord please please please
Take away my anxiety
The sane and the insane rivalry
Paranoias brought me to my knees
Lord please please please
Take away my anxiety
My head keeps running away my brother
The only thing making me stay my brother
But i won't give into it bro (no, no, no)
Gotta get myself back now
God, i can't let my mind be
Tell my enemy is my own
Gots to find my inner wealth
Gots to hold up my thoughts
I can't get caught (no, no, no)
I can't give into it now (no, no, no)
Emotions are trapped set on lock
Got my brain stuck goin through the motions
Only i know what's up
I'm filled up with pain
Tryin' to gain my sanity
Everywhere i turn its a dead end infront of me
With nowhere to go gotta shake this anxiety
Got me feelin' strange paranoia took over me
And its weighin' me down
And i can't run any longer, yo
Knees to the ground
I don't fear none of my enemies
And i don't fear bullets from oozies
I've been dealing with something thats worse than these
That'll make you fall to your knees and thats the
The anxiety the sane and the insane rivalry
Paranoias brought me to my knees
Lord please please please
Take away my anxiety
The sane and the insane rivalry
Paranoias brought me to my knees
Lord please please please
Take away my anxiety
I don't fear none of my enemies
And i don't fear bullets from oozies
I've been dealing with something thats worse than these
That'll make you fall to your knees and thats the
The anxiety the sane and the insane rivalry

Ohhhhh
Why should I try and judge the things they say
They just won't budge I'm letting go
Ohhhhhhh
And, shelter from the blind, storm
You managed to be kind
But still enough to show me how to keep it together
When I'm crying out in vain
No matter who's to blame
There's still a ways to go
Ooohhh
So if you ask me to believe your heart will follow you
It's got a mind of its own
When it sits wrong and the road gets rough
And you're the one
Whose shoulders just ain't wide enough
Whose shoulders shrug when they've had enough
I'll be the last to say, don't follow your heart
There's more to what it takes to be a man
Than what you know
What you've shown
And that we know you understand
Ohhhh
Another thing, if I were you
I would say all that I do to be half as strong
Or still belong
Ohhhhh
You should take the time to look back at all your misadventures
When it sits wrong and the road gets rough
And you're the one
Whose shoulders just ain't wide enough
Whose shoulders shrug when they've had enough
I'd be the last to say, don't follow your heart
But there's more to what it takes to be a man
Than what you've known
What you've shown
That's what I hope you understand
I never said, don't follow your heart
That's what it takes to be a man
From what you know
All that you've been shown
Even now I hope you understand
I'd be the last to say, don't follow your heart
But there's more to what it takes to be a man
Than what you know
What you've shown
And what we know you understand
I never said, don't follow your heart
That's what it takes to be a man
More than you know
All that you've been shown
Even now I hope you understand

Come easy, go easy, all right till the rising sun
I'm calling all the shots tonight I'm like a loaded gun
Peelin' off my boots and chaps I'm saddle sore
Four bits gets you time in the racks I scream for more
Fools' gold out of their mines the girls are soaking wet
No tongue's drier than mine I'll come when I get back
I'm back in the saddle again

Sail across the sea
Maybe you'll find somebody
That will love you half as much as me
My heart is always with you
No matter what you do
So sail away sweet sister
Cause I'll always be in love with you
But let her be somebody else's queen
I don't want to know about you
Cuz too many others know what I mean
And that's why I got to live without you
I'm in love with a girl

In my eyes, indisposed
In disguise as no one knows
Hides the face, lies the snake
In the sun in my disgrace
Boiling heat, summer stench
'Neath the black the sky looks dead
Call my name through the cream
And I'll hear you scream again
Black hole sun
Won't you come?
And wash away the rain
Black hole sun
Won't you come?
Won't you come?
Won't you come?
Stuttering, cold and damp
Steal the warm wind tired friend
Times are gone for honest men
And sometimes far too long for snakes
In my shoes, a walking sleep
And my youth I pray to keep
Heaven send hell away
No one sings like you anymore
Black hole sun
Won't you come?
And wash away the rain
Black hole sun
Won't you come?
Won't you come?

Mama, just killed a man
Put a gun against his head
Pulled my trigger, now he's dead
Mama, life had just begun
But now I've gone and thrown it all away
Mama, ooo
Didn't mean to make you cry
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow
Carry on, carry on,
As if nothing really matters
Too late, my time has come
Sends shivers down my spine
Body's aching all the time
Goodbye everybody - I've got to go
Gotta leave you all behind
And face the truth
Mama, ooo - I don't want to die
I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all
I see a little silhouetto of a man
Scaramouch, scaramouch will you do the fandango
Thunderbolt and lightning - very very frightening me
Gallileo, Gallileo,
Gallileo, Gallileo,
Gallileo Figaro - magnifico
But I'm just a poor boy and nobody loves me
He's just a poor boy from a poor family
Spare him his life from this monstrosity
Easy come easy go - will you let me go
Bismillah! No - we will not let you go -
Let him go
Bismillah! We will not let you go - let him go
Bismillah! We will not let you go - let me go
Will not let you go - let me go (never)
Never let you go - let me go
Never let me go - ooo
No, no, no, no, no, no, no -
Oh mama mia, mama mia, mama mia let me go
Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me
for me
for me
So you think
You can stone me and spit in my eye
So you think you can love me
And leave me to die
Oh baby - can't do this to me baby
Just gotta get out -
Just gotta get right outta here
Ooh yeah, ooh yeah
Nothing really matters
Anyone can see
Nothing really matters -
Nothing really matters to me
Anyway the wind blows...

Sweet little lady, don't you get crazy
Bring it back home to me
Woman little standing, dreaming to forget him
Bring it back home to me?
Brown-eyed stunner, come on,
Bring it home to me
Kiss a little, fishing for your lover,
Won't you bring it down home to me
See a sky lit on fire, seen the dog it here
She lit her lips, with a passion, in the third degree
See a dirty old lady, with a schoolgirl's grin
Break a back for the daddy all, when she does her things
You can see the love, like check an ounce of pain,
Darling won't you wanna;
Sorry to resent, you said; Gimme back
Keep your teeth
Never wanna hold you,
Never wanna kiss you,
I bet she's taking away from me
Never will repeat it, on never reprimand it,
Will you bring it back home to me
Take care before my baby,
When your baby gives it up for free
She just puts around, being lazy,
But since she brings her love to me
Don't need nothing to save me, say for a piece of your luxury
Like the doorfoot, you'll never gage it
I'll tell you just how it's gonna be
I call your lover in the morning,
When you have your cup of tea
You never give me your warning,
So you better give her right up for me
Guess who's coming over, on your thinks;
That's such a surprise
If you're saying you never know her,
Honey, you better open your eyes
Look out
See a real long fire, she's the dog in here
She lift her lips, with a passion, in the third degree
See a dirty old lady, with a schoolgirl's grin
Break a back for the daddy all, when she does her things
Can't take care before my baby,
When your baby gives it up for free
She just gets around being lazy
Until she brings me her loving to me
I don't need nothing to save me,
Say for a piece of your luxury
Lock the door, but you'll never gage me
I tell you just how it's gonna be
I call your lover in the morning,
When you have your cup of tea
You never give me your warning,
So get yourself a letter from me
Oh, where're you going, tell me;
Who're you to see?
I've been sleeping on your doorstep,
Baby, won't you bring it back ho to me
Get me something for my jealous mind,
You don't get something for free
You just bring it down home to me
Ha-Ha-Ha

Crash diet of reds'n'ludes
A shot of vitamin C and a bottle of booze
Too stupid to live with nothin' to lose
In your one track mind now
Where's that leave you?
Drink'n'drive white lightning faster baby
Takin' your last ride
Now better be so careful or you'll be dead before you time
Sorry you took mother's car now
Tears in my eyes, baby please don't go
You bet one in too many, Havin' one for the road
fresh from detox, fresh from jail
Took your rehabilitation and you drove me to hell
Drink'n'drive white lightning faster hmm
Takin' your last ride
Better be so careful or you'll be dead before your time
Sorry you took mother's car now
Too soon, for those who didn't mean it
Too late for the pressure and blame
Too bad for those who don't believe it
Ruby street still calls your name
Itchy trigger finger and the race to be alive
Smokin' a cig while you drink'n'drive
With no control in your life ahead
You're never gonna see if you wind up dead
Drink'n'drive white lightning faster
Takin' your last ride
Better be so careful or you'll be dead before your time
Drink'n'drive white lightning baby
It's always on your mind
when you Put your a limit baby, do it one more time
Take it down
Break it down
Somethin's changin', somethin's breakin'
You gotta be abroad outta your family
baby one more time to make it
Sweet history, Ooohhhh
If you don't care about yourself
Would you please take me alive
Oooohhhh...
You gonna
You gonna drink'n'drive

Movin with a style and ease

Yes its love in the third degree.

Dance the night away

But just watch that lady go.

Cause dancin gets her higher than
Anything else she knows.

If we could see tomorrow
What of your plans
No one can live in sorrow
Ask all your friends
Times that you took in stride they're
Back in demand
I was the one who's washing
Blood off your hands
Don't you cry tonight
I still love you baby
Don't you cry tonight
Don't you cry tonight
There's a heaven above you baby
And don't you cry tonight
I know the things you wanted
They're not what you have
With all the people talkin'
It's drivin' you mad
If I was standin' by you
How would you feel
Knowing your love's decided
And all love is real, baby
And don't you cry tonight
Don't you cry tonight
Don't you cry tonight
There's a heaven above you baby
And don't you cry tonight
I thought I could live in your world
As years all went by
With all the voices
I've heard
Something has died
And when you're in need of someone
My heart won't deny you
So many seem so lonely
With no one left to cry to baby
And don't you cry tonight
And don't you cry tonight
And don't you cry tonight
There's a heaven above you baby
And don't you cry
Don't you ever cry
Don't you cry
Don't you cry tonight
Baby maybe someday
Don't you cry
Don't you ever cry
Don't you cry
Don't you cry tonight

Old man lying by the side of the road
With the lorries rolling by
Blue moon sinking from the weight of the load
And the building scrape the sky
Cold wind ripping down the allay at dawn
And the morning paper flies
Dead man lying by the side of the road
With the daylight in his eyes
Don't let it bring you down
It's only castles burning
Find someone who's turning
And you will come around
Blind man running through the light of the night
With an answer in his hand
Come on down to the river of sight
And you can really understand
Red lights flashing through the window in the rain
Can you hear the sirens moan?
White cane lying in a gutter in the lane
If you're walking home alone
Don't let it bring you down
It's only castles burning
Just find someone who's turning
And you will come around
Don't let it bring you down
It's only castles burning
Just find someone who's turning
And you will come around

Day after day I'm more confused
So I look for the light in the pouring rain
You know that's a game that I hate to lose
I'm feelin' the strain, ain't it a shame
Oh, give me the beat, boys, and free my soul
I wanna get lost in your rock and roll and drift away
Oh, give me the beat, boys, and free my soul
I wanna get lost in your rock and roll and drift away
Beginning to think that I'm wastin' time
I don't understand the things I do
The world outside looks so unkind
I'm countin' on you to carry me through
And when my mind is free
You know a melody can move me
And when I'm feelin' blue
The guitar's comin' through to soothe me
Thanks for the joy that you've given me
I want you to know I believe in your song
Rhythm and rhyme and harmony
You help me along makin' me strong

She's a good girl, crazy 'bout Elvis
Loves horses, and her boyfriend too.
And it's a long day, livin' in Reseda
There's a freeway, runnin' thru the yard
And i'm a bad boy
'Cause i don't even miss her
I'm a bad boy, for breaking
And i'm free, free falling.
Yeah i'm free, free falling.
And all the vampires walkin' through the valley
Move west down Ventura Boulevard.
And all the bad boys
Are standin' in the shadows
And the good girls
Are home with broken hearts.
And i'm free, free falling.

I wanna glide down over Mulholland
I wanna write her name in the sky.
I'm gonna free fall out into nothin'
Gonna leave this world for a while.

I've known my share of pain
It's a crown of thorns
That never seems to break the skin
There's no blood in the scars
Just your broken heart
You used to be so sweet
You walked with a smile
Life tastes funny and the coffee's cold
Amuse yourself, make you useful
You've got nothing good to say
Keep your mouth shut
Nothing good to do
Keep it to yourself
Nothing's ever good enough for you
Sick of everything that you say
It's going down
Sorry for everything
Sick of everything that you do
It's going down
You look like a fool
You never mean to hurt no one
They just happen to be there next to you
'Cause you're going down
I know this dark place
I heard these words
On the tip of a million tongues
I've heard them yelled
I've even heard them sung
Get into your car and drive
Just as fast as you can
You've had your 15 minutes
You tried to take an hour but
Now no one, hears your call
You've got nothing good to say
Keep your mouth shut
Nothing good to do
Keep it to yourself
Nothing's ever good enough for you
Sick of everything that you say
It's going down
Sorry for everything
Sick of everything that you do
It's going down
You look like a fool
You never mean to hurt no one
They just happen to be there next to you
'Cause you're going down
'Cause you're going down
'Cause you're going down
'Cause you're going down
'Cause you're going down

All cautions made
Every chance was given
No effort spared
To save what we had
All in good faith
I would not hesitate
To extend myself
And lend you a hand
But you had to play it cool, had to do it your way
Had to be a fool, had to throw it all away
Too hard school
And you thought you were here to stay
If that were true, it wouldn't matter anyway
As tempers fade
And lies forgiven
No God's embrace
Could break what we had
And in it's place
A storm had lifted
I would've thought you could've been more of a man
But you had to play it cool, had to do it your way
Had to be a fool, had to throw it all away
Too hard school
And you thought you were here to stay
If that were true, it wouldn't matter anyway
Too hard school
And you thought you were here to stay
If that were true, it wouldn't matter anyway

Well, since my baby left me,
I found a new place to dwell.
It's down at the end of lonely street
At heartbreak hotel.
You make me so lonely baby,
I get so lonely,
I get so lonely i could die.
And although it's always crowded,
You still can find some room.
Where broken hearted lovers
Do cry away their gloom.
You make me so lonely baby,
I get so lonely,
I get so lonely i could die.
Well, the bell hop's tears keep flowin',
And the desk clerk's dressed in black.
Well they been so long on lonely street
They ain't ever gonna look back.
You make me so lonely baby,
I get so lonely,
I get so lonely i could die.
Hey now, if your baby leaves you,
And you got a tale to tell.
Just take a walk down lonely street
To heartbreak hotel.
And don't make me cry

Asking nothing, leave me be
Taking everything in my stride

She had to heave me right across shoulder

I'm livin' every moment
Like its my last
You could say I push too hard
But I like it fast
There ain't nothing
On what you can depend
What you call your highway
Could be your dead-end
Luck ain't got the time
To be your friend or mine
I'm doin' nothing
I'm killing time
Don't get me wrong
Don't wanna bring you down
Take or give it as it comes
Don't waste your life now hangin' around
Sometimes when you're on your own
You look around and find yourself all alone
Luck ain't got the time
To be your friend or mine
I make my living
Killing time
Running late killing time
We're doing over, overtime
Spend your life on borrowed dime
I make my living killing time
Say you're depressed
You've been resist
Shake it, now don't you fake it
You're the one who wants to make it
Don't fake on anything
Cuz it's in your hands
Stand up every time you fall
You gotta show the world you're feelin' down
Luck ain't got the time
To be your friend or mine
I make my living
Killing time
Running late killing time
We're doing over, overtime
Spend your life on borrowed dime
I make my living killing time

Got nothing to lose

Gimme a whiskey, don't think twice
Deal me the card that takes my blues away
Take me away to Marseilles

Don't ask no reasons why

You see it on television every day
You hear it on the radio
It ain't humid but it sure is hot
Way down in Mexico
Police tryin' to tell me
Beginnin' of the end
Sayin' it'll bend me
Too late my friend
Riff raff
Well it's good for a laugh
Riff raff
Go on and laugh yourself in half
Havin' a good time
Now I'm the kind of guy that keeps my big mouth shut
But don't bother me
Somebody kickin' me when I'm up
Leave me in misery
I never shot nobody
Don't even carry a gun
I ain't done nothing wrong
I'm havin' fun
Riff raff
Oh well it's good for a laugh
Riff raff
Go on laugh yourself in half
Thank you
So nice to be back

Gentlemen, it's time to rock the rock
Turn it up
Make it loud
Get your guitar ready to scream
Heavy drums; Amplifiers
We're a sonic demolition team
You gotta rock the rock
Pound it all around
Rock the rock
With a stone crunching sound
Ooh, rock the rock
Hammer and grind
Rock the rock
It's gravel makin' time
Get in the ring, we'll give you a brawl
We're employed to destroy
We're a rock 'n' roll wrecking ball
You gotta rock the rock
Smash it to bits
Rock the rock
With a heavy metal fist
Rock the rock
Grind it to the bone
Rock the rock
It's a destruction zone
Supersized, pulverized
We're telling no lies
Rock the rock
Annihilate you
Devastate you
Eviscerate you
Rock the rock
Rock the rock
Rock the rock
Rock the rock
Rock the rock, yeah
(Rock the rock) rock the rock

Sail away sweet sister
Sail across the sea
Maybe you'll find somebody
That love happens as much as me
My heart is always with you
No matter what you do
So sail away sweet sister
'cause I'll always be in love with you
But if you love somebody else, sweetheart
I do not want know about of you
'cause you see many others, you know what I mean
That's why I gotta live without you
I'm in love with a girl, I'm talking about
I'm in love with a girl that I cant live without
I'm in love, but it seems that
I'm livin' without
I'm in love, but the worst season to be
Is that one to be in love

I am sailing, I am sailing
Home again across the sea.
I am sailing, stormy waters
To be near you, to be free.
I am flying, I am flying,
Like a bird across the sky
I am flying, passing high clouds
To be with you, to be free.
Can you hear me? Can you hear me?
Through the dark night, far away
I am dying, forever crying
To be with you, who can say?
Can you hear me? Can you hear me?
Through the dark night, far away.
I am dying, forever dying,
To be with you, who can say?
We are sailing, we are sailing,
Home again across the sea.

To be near you, to be free.
Oh Lord, to be near you, to be free.
Oh Lord, to be near you, to be free.

Lets drink to the hard working people,
Lets drink to the lowly of birth.
Raise your glass to the good and the evil,
Lets drink to the salt of the earth.
Say a prayer for the common foot soldier,
Spare a thought for his back breaking work.
Say a prayer for his wife and his children,
Who burn the fires and who still till the earth.
And when I search a faceless crowd,
A swirling mass of gray and black and white.
They don't look real to me,
In fact, they look so strange.
Raise your glass to the hard working people,
Lets drink to the uncounted heads.
Lets think of the wandering millions,
Who need leaders but get gamblers instead.
Spare a thought for the stay at home voter,
His empty eyes gaze at strange beauty shows.
And a parade of the gray suited grafters,
A choice of cancer or polio.
And when I search a faceless crowd,
A swirling mass of gray and black and white.
They don't look real to me,
In fact, they look so strange.
Lets drink to the hard working people,
Lets think of the lowly of birth.
Spare a thought for the rag taggy people,
Sets drink to the salt of the earth.
Lets drink to the hard working people,
Lets drink to the salt of the earth.
Lets think of the two thousand million,
Lets think of the humble of birth.
Lets drink to the hard working people,
Lets drink to the lowly of birth.
Raise your glass to the good and the evil,
Lets drink to the salt of the earth.
Say a prayer for the common foot soldier,
Spare a thought for his back breaking work.
Say a prayer for his wife and his children,
Who burn the fires and who still till the earth.

Don't you try to stop us now
I just refuse
Don't you try to stop us now
Cause I just won't let you
Sometimes I feel like
The world is on top of me
Breakin' me down with
An endless monotony
Sometimes I feel like
There's nothing that's stopping me
All things are possible
I am unstoppable
Some may convince you
No one can break through
I'm here to tell you
You're worth
More than they tell you
Don't you try to stop us now

Don't you try to stop us now
Cause I just won't let you
Sometimes I feel like
My life's a catastrophe
Can't understand why
It seem's like it has to be
Sometimes I feel like
It's all opened up for me
Nothing's impossible
I am inconquerable
No one can make you
Do what they want to
You know you're stronger
Than the lies
That they tell you
Don't you try to stop us now
(I'd give anything to know)
I just refuse
Don't you try to stop us now

Thrown down in the gutter, it's more than you deserve
Kneeling fucking virgin, you know that's what you are
Pussy for a maggot, isn't that a shock

You know that it's true
All I have ask of you
I'll be dammed

A bitch like you
Get your head down in the sky
Fucking little schemer got yourself a broken heart

Parasitis demons sucking acid through your heart

I am a man cold and ugly,
Within me take a terrible hatred
Have killed thousands of people without knowing that
Looks like i'm immortal
That never came close to death
Matador i'ma murderer, baby
Do not try to approach me because i
I can also kill you, murderer!
I'm a murderer!
I am a killer white skin
Ingenues like scary people
I am very sinister and there
Nothing i can do now
In my blood i can not stop,
But after a few hours i started
Reflect on my actions and that was when i realized
He did not like me to be forgiven
Killer killer am
I did not want that shit!
Now i am left alone to die
Also

Time has passed.
We're getting older.
You know that it's true.
Lose the pain.
I know you got to.
I know you do.
Go a phone call.
It went like this,,,
"You wanna be in the band?"
"I want to."
"You wanna star in the show?"
"You know that I want to."
I gotta let you know. Oh no.
Come on steve, dust of those drums.
I got shot with you velvet revolver.
It broke me in two.
I'm not dead.
I've got some life left.
Don't bury me too soon.
"Remember getting to high?"
"I want to."
Remember getting to low?"
"Don't you know that I want to."
I couldn't let you go. Oh no.

What can I say
Free will is blind today
The choice that you made
Is not a road that I would take
To use and betray
Simple as the power play
Not far away
With tears that go unexplained now
Oh, my love, can it be?
I’m falling from your grace with me now
Oh, more than ever
I still remember
They’re saying
It’s just a passing phase
No more like a game
Problems of the human race
Goes right to your brain
Caught down in a hidden place
With no sense of shame
The secrets are there and you can’t
Oh, my love, can it be?
I’m falling from your grace with me
Now more than ever
I still remember your name
When do you think you can tell me?
How long do you think I can wait? Oh no I said
I thought I never said I was sorry
Now dont you fall on your face now with livin with it
The storm is comin ‘again
I sense the shiverin’ down
You thought you had it, ah
But thought you had it figured it out
But you do not even care
How could it be?
You’re fallingin ‘from your grace with me
And now, my love
I ask
I ask myself what I believe in
‘Cause now
More than ever
I still remember
Your name

Destroyed your notion of circular time
It's just that demon life has got you in its sway

But if you love somebody else

You know what I mean and

I've looked under chairs
I've looked under tables
I've tried to find the key
To fifty million fables
They call me The Seeker
I've been searching low and high
I won't get to get what I'm after
Till the day I die
I asked Bobby Dylan
I asked The Beatles
I asked Timothy Leary
But he couldn't help me either
They call me The Seeker
I've been searching low and high
I won't get to get what I'm after

'Cause I never smile

They wanna shake my hand
Focusing on nowhere
Investigating miles
I'm a seeker
I'm a really desperate man
I won't get to get what I'm after
Till the day I die
I learned how to raise my voice in anger
Yeah, but look at my face, ain't this a smile?
I'm happy when life's good and when it's bad I cry
I've got values but I don't know how or why
I'm looking for me
You're looking for you
We're looking in at each other
And we don't know what to do

"Hey this bottle's empty, you got 2 bucks?
C'mon, we'll buy a bottle
Alright, I'm headin' to the store and I'm gonna buy smokes
Hot damn"
Every night, I go out and get in my car, oh yeah
I push on the pedal but you know I go too far
There're parties everywhere that I can see
Usin' myself will be the death of me
Ya see every night I get a call on the telephone
My sweet little baby beggin' me just to come home
But I know that everyday I gotta have me some fun
With Suzy to the left and Sally to my right
I know that I need just more than one
Chorus
Said it's too much too fast
I don't care if I won't last
Said it's too much too soon
I don't care, get outta my room
Said it's too much too fast
I don't care if I won't last
Said it's too much too soon
I don't care, get outta my room
Let's go
When the night goes on and I seem to see some friends
Not a buck for the car for the gas goes so fast?
With friends like that tell me who's gonna last
Well the city's hot but tonight I'm not
I want everything that everybody's got
Not a badge in the pan or a legend hand
Just give me one more, one last dance
Said it's too much too fast
I don't care if I won't last
Said it's too much too soon
I don't care, get outta my room
Said it's too much too fast
I don't care if I won't last
Said it's too much too soon
I don't care, get outta my room
Let's go
Take the car, take the keys
Said my money don't grow on trees
You make me stumble and fall
T'ill I'm bloody at my knees?
I climbed back up to find that all my money's gone
Too much too soon not know since it's been so long?
You can drive me to the edge but I really don't mind
Ya see when I'm in my car I leave you behind
There's another girl that's waitin' down the road
When I'm out the door you know that's just where I'll go
Said it's too much too fast
I don't care if I won't last
Said it's too much too soon
I don't care, get outta my room
Said it's too much too fast

On the road for forty days,
Last night in Little Rock put me in a haze.
Sweet, sweet Connie -- doin' her act,
She had the whole show and that's a natural fact.
Up all night with Freddy King,
I got to tell you poker's his thing.
A-booze 'n ladies keep me right,
As long as we can make it to the show tonight.
CHORUS
We're an American band.
We're an American band.
We're coming to your town, we'll help you party it down.
We're an American band.
Four young chaquitas in Omaha,
Was waitin' for the band to return from the show.
Feelin' good, feelin' right, it's Saturday night,
The hotel detective -- he was out-a-sight.
Now, these fine ladies, they had a plan,
They was out to meet the boys in the band.
They said, "Come on, dudes, let's get it on,"
And we proceeded to tear that hotel down.

Wanna tell you a story
'Bout a woman I know
When it comes to lovin'
Oh she steals the show
She ain't exactly pretty
Ain't exactly small
Forty-two, thirty-nine, fifty-six
You could say she's got it all
Never had a woman
Never had a woman like you
Doing all the things
Doing all the things you do
Ain't no fairy story
Ain't no skin and bone
But you give it all you got
Weighing in at nineteen stone
CHORUS:
You're a whole lotta woman
A whole lotta woman
Whole lotta Rosie
And you're a whole lotta woman
Oh honey you can do it
Do it to me all night long
Only one to turn
Only one to turn me on
All through the night time
And right around the clock
To my surprise
Rosie never stops

And if it snows that stretch down south
Won't ever stand the strain

She was a fast machine she kept her motor clean
She was the best damn woman that I ever seen
She had the sightless eyes telling me no lies
Knocking me out with those American thighs
Taking more than her share
Had me fighting for air
She told me to come, but I was already there
'Cause the walls start shaking
The earth was quaking
My mind was aching
And we were making it
And you shook me all night long
Yeah, you shook me all night long
Working double time on the seduction line
She's one of a kind, she's just mine, all mine
Wanted no applause it's just another course
Made a meal outta me
And come back for more
Had to cool me down to take another round
Now I'm back in the ring to take another swing
'Cause the walls were shaking the earth was quaking
My mind was aching
And we were making it
And you shook me all night long
Yeah, you shook me all night long
It knocked me out I said you
Shook me all night long
You had me shaking and you
Shook me all night long
Yeah, you shook me
When you took me
You really took me and you
Shook me all night long
Ah, you shook me all night long
Yeah, yeah, you shook me all night long
You really got me and you
Shook me all night long

All right, these are all new songs
We didn't wanna, you know, trot out the same old bollocks
Might be a good idea just to bring to this
Extraordinary shining country some new songs
Lift you up, not that you need us to lift us up
Thank you for lifting us up
Joe Strummer used to lift me up
When I was a kid listening to punk rock records
The Clash were our favorite group
And this is the last song that he ever wrote
With his wife Louise, and Elijah his daughter are here too
And I'm singing it for them too
I want you to sing it with me
It's a long (long)
It's a long walk, long walk to freedom
It's a long walk, long walk to freedom
When freedom rises from the killing floor
No lock of iron or rivet can restrain the door
And no kind of army can hope to win a war
It's like trying to stop the rain or still the lion's roar
It's a long walk, long walk to freedom
It's a long walk, long walk to freedom
It's like trying to stop the whirlwind scattering seeds and spores
Like trying to stop the tin cans rattling jailhouse semaphore
Like laying when your spins are manacled its your spirit that gets raw
It's not the small little patch of sky you see, but the spirit it, it soars
And long walk, long walk to freedom
It's a long walk, long walk to freedom
My Man, Adbul Jamaica
When freedom arise from the killing floor
Can't stop the rain nor lions that roar
No matter whirlwind, scatter seeds and spore
From the sky, world visions of poor
Six waves come, then seventh break shore
We don't wanna distant, when you a killa boar
What I'm trying to say, this thing gone high, yay
What's in store, what's in store
Sing this one:
4-6-6 6-4
4-6-6 6-4
4-6-6 6-4
4-6-6 6-4
4-6-6 6-4
In the ghettos of the colors don't forget the human core
In townships of humanity there would be no poor
From when the rock is heavy comes the purest ore
The first six waves might break in the bay, the seventh breaks on the shore
It's a long walk, long walk to freedom
It's a long walk, long walk to freedom
4-6-6 6-4 / It's a long walk
4-6-6 6-4 / Long walk to freedom
4-6-6 6-4 / It's a long walk
4-6-6 6-4 / Long walk to freedom
It's a long walk, long walk to freedom
4-6-6 6-4 / It's a long walk
4-6-6 6-4 / Long walk to freedom
It's a long walk, long walk to freedom
Sing with me
It's a long walk, long walk to freedom
It's a long walk, long walk to freedom
It's a long walk, long walk to freedom
It's a long walk, long walk to freedom
It's a long walk, long walk to freedom
It's a long walk, long walk to freedom
It's a long walk, long walk to freedom
It's a long walk, long walk to freedom
It's a long walk, long walk to freedom
It's a long walk, long walk to freedom
It's a long walk, long walk to freedom
It's a long walk, long walk to freedom
Not just a president for South Africa
Not just a president for Africa
This is a president for anyone, anywhere
Who knows freedom

I believe you can dance with me, dance with me.
Shake! Shake!

I believe in the Third World War
I believe in the atomic bomb.
I believe in the powers-that-be
But they won't overpower me.
And you can go there too,
And you can go, go, go, go!
Shake! Shake!
Shake! Shake!
And we don't have the time
And everything goes round and round
And we don't have the time
To watch the world go tumbling down.
I believe in the bells of Christchurch
Ringing for this land.
I believe in the cells of Mountjoy
There's an honest man.
And you can go there too, etc.
I believe in the walls of Jericho
I believe they're coming down.
I believe in this city's children
I believe the trumpet's sound.

If you’re looking for a night out on the town
You just found me
A freak like me needs company
I’m a 65 million dollar circus tragedy
A freak like me needs company
I’m not rollin’, baby rollin’
In the green but I’m unique
Freak, a freak, freak
I’m the new coney island
And all the rides are open and free
On me
Freak like me needs company
All the weirdos in the world
Are right here in new york city
All the brazen boys and girls
Dressed to kill without pity
All the weirdos from out of town
And all the freaks always around
All the weirdos in the world
Are here in new york city tonight
Here in new york city tonight
I got a crew of party animal mutants by my side
A freak like me needs company
Demon hairdo evil dressers who just won’t be denied
A freak like me needs company
The crossroads of the roads just need a little tweak
From a freak
I said goodbye to my straight life
‘Cause I love a freak
A freak like me needs company
All the weirdos in the world
Are here right now in new york city
All the brazen boys and girls
Peacocks, posers show no pity
All the weirdos from out of town
And all the freaks always around
All the weirdos in the world
Are here in new york city tonight
Here in new york city tonight
Oh yeah
That’s the boys
And the ladies sing

I tried speaking, but my language was very thick
Oh oh the baby, I had sufficiently of this if to cagar

Bad seed, rye drink is my fuel to fly

That pace is too hot to handle
As stories that are too good to be true
You want to join in the action
And do believe it came from you
And then you begin to erect the time
Because who has time to down there?
But in the noise and confusion
You are losing contact with the sound
Of the air waves ...
Check the message in the air waves
Do not let it escape
A lover escorrega in its orbit
To show a path easier
But as an idiot you think that the mission it
We supply the parts that are missing in you
And then you discover that it can not deliver
His world is upside-down
And the noise and confusion
You are losing contact with the sound
Of the air waves ...
Check the message in the air waves
All you need is in the air waves
Oh, do not let it escape ...
Because the time will come / Check the message
When I and you are one / In the air waves
Getting / Check the message
To touch the hearts of all / On the air waves
The time will come / Check the message, in the air waves
When I and you are one / Check the message
Getting / In the air waves
To touch the hearts of all / Check the message

(Check the message, in the air waves)
(The heart is beating, in the air waves)

It's not the noise it's the deafening silence
Drowns God out

You're like the river flowing underground
I can feel you when you're not around
All because of you

And time time
You said, to all mine
Shut your tiny heart

Here today
And gone tomorrow
Crack the bone, get to the marrow
To be the bee
And the flower
Before the sweetness turns to sour
What we have we're gonna keep... always
What we've lost we don't need... always
What is it that won't let you sleep... always
Be the arrow
And the target
Put your head over the parapet
Be uncool
Yes, be awkward
And don't look in the obvious place
The soul needs beauty for a soul mate
Get down off your holy cloud... always
God will not deal with the proud... always
Well if you dream then dream out loud... always
Eternally yours... always
I want you
I want you
I want you
(Here she come)
Touching the other side
I wanted to be in love
I wanted to call
(Hey, soon soon)
You say come to know yourself... always
Don't find yourself in someone else... always
And always wear a safety belt... always
Wait for me I'm running late... always
This is the moment that we share... for always
Turn each song into a prayer... always
Now and forever
For always
For always
For always
For always

Alright, yeah, wow
This is a tune Beyonce and us have been working on
It's funny how religious people are sometimes the most judgemental
And anyway, this is a song we wrote it's called American Prayer
It could be anything, Irish Prayer, could be African Prayer
It's just a message to the churches that we really need you
To open your door and give sanctuary and break the stigmatization
That goes with being HIV positive
If God loves you, what's the problem?
And this is the time to finish what we started
And this is no time to dream
This is the room
We can turn off the dark tonight
Maybe then we might see
I wanna know the healing of American Prayer
I wanna know the meaning of American Prayer
I want to believe in American Prayer
But I can hear children screaming American Prayer
This is the ground
That keeps our feet from getting wet
And this is the sky over our head
Remember that, what you see depends on where you stand
And how you jump will tell you where you're gonna land
I wanna know the healing of American Prayer
I wanna know the meaning of American Prayer
I want to believe in American Prayer
But I can hear children screaming American Prayer
Hold on, let's not get tired / Hold on, no no no
Don't kick at the darkness
Make the lights brighter
An African Prayer
This is our African Prayer
I wanna know the healing of an African Prayer
I wanna know the meaning of an African Prayer
I want to believe in an African Prayer
But I can hear children screaming African Prayer
Oh, Quinby, Beyonce... / Bono
How about you babe?

But savor the mess that we tried
What is it when the clock just won't rewind

I'm telling you
Waving a white flag
Baby got a white flag flying for you baby
Got a white flag, a white flag
Angels too tied to the ground
Angels too tied to the ground
Angels too tied to the ground
And now it's only alive in my head

Wake up
The dawn of another dull day
Take up
Your dreams and on your way
Daylight
Mother stands in the hall
Last night
Head against the wall
When night turns to day
And the children come out to play
Another day
Stop, shake out
They come my way
Boy, salute in a street uniform
Toy, soldier ripped and torn
When night turns to day
And the children come out to play
Another day
Stop, shout
They came my way

Bright morning lights
Wipe the sleep
From another day's eye
Turn away from the wall
And there's nothing at all
Being naked and afraid
In the open space of my bed
I'll be with you now
I'll be with you now
I'll be with you now
We lie on a cloud, we lie
Just as I am
I awoke with a tear on my tongue
I awoke with a feeling of never before
In my sleep, I discovered the one
But she ran with the morning sun
I'll be with you now
I'll be with you now
I'll be with you now
We lie on a cloud, we lie
Another time, another place
We lie
Another child has lost the race
We lie
Another time, another place

Another child has lost

You don't have to worry, have to worry

Hear the voice of the Bard
Who present, past, and future, sees
Whose ears have heard
The Holy Word
That walk'd among the ancient trees
Calling the lapsed soul
And weeping in the evening dew
That might control
The starry pole
And fallen, fallen light renew
O Earth, O Earth, return
Arise from out the dewy grass
Night is worn
And the morn
Rises from the slumbrous mass
Turn away no more
Why wilt thou turn away
The starry floor
The watery shore
Is given thee till the break of day
Till the break of day
Till the break of day
Till the break of day
Till the break of day

Take me now baby here as I am
Pull me close try an understand
I work all day out in the hot sun
Stay with me now till the mornin' comes
Come on now try and understand
The way I feel when I'm in your hands
Take me now as the sun descends
They can't hurt you now
They can't hurt you now
They can't hurt you now
Because the night belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to us
Because the night belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to us
What I got I have earned
What I'm not I have learned
Desire and hunger is the fire I breathe
Just stay in my bed till the morning comes
Come on now try and understand
The way I feel when I'm in your hands
Take me now as the sun descends
They can't hurt you now
They can't hurt you now
They can't hurt you now
Because the night
Your love is here and now
The vicious circle turns and burns without
Though I cannot live forgive me now
The time has come to take this moment and
They can't hurt you now
Because the night

Six o'clock
On the autoroute
Burning rubber, burning chrome
Bay of Cadiz and ferry home
Atlantic sea cut glass
African sun at last
Lights... flash past...
Like memories
A speeding head, a speeding heart
I'm being born, a bleeding start
The engines roar, blood curling wail
Head first then foot
The heart sets sail

You've been along this road so many times
Nothing should be a surprise to you
Seen every premeditated crime
From every possible point of view
Why, if it's so wrong, does it feel so right
Why, oh I've got your gun
Do I want you tonight
She, she's gonna blow your house down
She's gonna turn your head around
She's gonna blow your house down
What of chaos is the thing you crave
Is it the taste of self-inflicted pain
And what of losing is your drug of choice
Is it what keeps you coming back again
Why, if it's so wrong, does it feel so right
She, she's gonna blow your house down
She's gonna turn your head around
She's gonna blow your house down
She blow your house down
She's gonna turn your head around
She's gonna blow your house down
Run fast, fast as you can
Run fast, fast as you can
Fast, fast as you can
Run as fast, fast as you can
Fast as you can
Run as fast, fast as you can
The wave, it have its
She was saving it
What makes you think you can
Oh, they're craving
Deals for breaking
Your old devil's hands
She, she's gonna blow your house down
She's gonna turn your head around
She's gonna blow your house down
She gonna blow your house down
She's gonna turn your head around

I'm in the moon... yeah
All right, let's sing it
No fuel on the car
No money on the car
How we take it away, baby
No moon in the sky
No tile to keep us dry.
See the rain tonight
I have a feeling sick
Coming on me
I tried to paint a portrait
A picture through the clouds for you.
(My, my, my)
Green - your smile
Red - why I made you cry
Gray - this rainy sky
Tomorrow I will be
Blue - Stay love
Keep this evening
This rainy sky
Tomorrow I will be blue
No caffeine in coffee
No sugar in my tea
Only watching TV
With the sound down
None connected Radio
No melody to the music
And the words are wrong
His fingers beating
In rhythm of the rain
His fingers
I tried to paint a picture
A photo over you
(Yeah, my, my, my)

Green - its look cool
Red - why I made you cry
Gray - those days Rainy
Tomorrow I will be
Blue - Stay love
Keep this evening
This rainy sky

Do not say goodbye

She dance in the rain, was lost in our games
Turn our backs to the world the night
Sleep in the grass
Stay tuned for passage of the seasons
While the days leading our innocence
We are holding in safety
But we can not open
The summer so early for Vanessa

Boy Falls From Sky
You can change your mind
But you cannot change your heart
It's a compass and a map
The key to the chart
I'd be myself
If I knew I'd become
You can fly too high
And get too close to the sun
See how the boy falls from the sky
Not every wanderer
Is lost or far from home
I didn't have to move so far
To find myself alone
Save, you save yourself
If you even get that right
I used to use a single thread
To cross the sky
And now the eye of the needle
Is your heart denied
The boy falls from the sky
Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhh
The city conducts a symphony
And such soul trash your melody
A single scrap of dignity
In the junkyard of humanity
To hear the voice inside your head
Listen now to no one else
You know exactly what to do
Believe in me
Believe in you
You take a look at my self esteem
And when you do
When you do
Ohhhhhhhhhhh
Believe

Secret destroyers, hold you up to the flames

And the house'll be shakin' from my bare feet slappin' the floor

If your brother won't rock you then your sister will
Ooo c'mon everybody
Well we'll really have a party but we gotta put a guard outside
If my folks come home I'm afraid they're gonna have my hide

Only fools rush in
But I can't help
Falling in love... with you
Shall I stay?
Would it be a sin?
If I can't help
Falling in love... with you
Like a river flows
To the sea
So it goes
Somethings were meant to be
Take my hand
Take my whole life too
'Cause I can't help
Falling in love with you
I can't help
Falling in love...
No I can't help
Falling in love...
No I can't help

Goodbye Norma Jean
Though I never knew you at all
You had the grace to hold yourself
While those around you crawled
They crawled out of the woodwork
And they whispered into your brain
They set you on the treadmill
And they made you change your name
And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never knowing who to cling to
When the rain set in
And I would have liked to have known you
But I was just a kid
Your candle burned out long before
Your legend ever did
Loneliness was tough
The toughest role you ever played
Hollywood created a superstar
And pain was the price you paid
Even when you died
Oh the press still hounded you
All the papers had to say
Was that Marilyn was found in the nude
Goodbye Norma Jean
From the young man in the 22nd row
Who sees you as something as more than sexual
More than just our Marilyn Monroe

It's Christmas
Baby, please come home

(Yeah!)

The snow's coming down
I'm watching it fall
Watching the people around
Baby please come home

The church bells in town
They're ringing a song
What a happy sound
Baby please come home

They're singing deck the halls
But it's not like Christmas at all
I remember when you were here
And all the fun we had last year

Pretty lights on the tree
I'm watching 'em shine
You should be here with me
Baby please come home

Baby please come home
Baby please come home

They're singing deck the halls
But it's not like Christmas at all
I remember when you were here
And all the fun we had last year

If there was a way
I'd hold back these tears
But it's Christmas day
Baby please come home
Ohh...

Ohh...

I'm tired, so tired I can hardly stand
I can't breathe in the air in this city tonight
It's taken everything I had to give
And now, I just want to get out of here
But I won't be sorry if you won't be
And I don't want your pity or sympathy
But for forty five dollars I can make it
You wait and see
He came from miami to start out again
I hear that he's back with his mother ill
He told me he loved me and he wanted my child
But you know people change their minds
But I won't be sorry if you won't be
And I don't want your pity or sympathy
But with forty five dollars I can make it
You wait and see
But I won't be sorry if you won't be
And I don't want your pity or your sympathy
But with forty five dollars I can make it
You wait and see
It isn't as if I was just anybody
On broadway I danced for that senator
They know me in london and they know me in paris
I'm only talking because you look like you needed a friend
But I won't sorry if you won't be
And I don't want your pity or your sympathy
But with forty five dollars
I'm halfway to miami

Hey, see you soon
Sail through your room
I'll meet you there

Hey, be my friend
Stay 'til the end
Don't walk away
Hey, hey, hey, hey...

Hey, take 'em off
Don't talk that way
Don't feel my lover say
Hey, hey, hey...

Chains move that thing
Chains we can see
My chains way too long
Chains in this
Chains move that thing
Chains we could see
Chains are way too long
And I hear my song
Hear my song

Forward yesterday
Makes me wanna stay
What they said was real
Makes me wanna steal
Livin' under house
Guess I'm livin', I'm a mouse
All's I gots is time
Got no meaning, just a rhyme
Take time with a wounded hand
'Cause it likes to heal
Take time with a wounded hand
'Cause I like to steal
Take time with a wounded hand
'Cause it likes to heal,
I like to steal
I'm half the man I used to be
Because I feel as the dawn
It fades to gray
Well, I'm half the man I used to be
Because I feel as the dawn
It fades to gray
Well, I'm half the man I used to be
Because I feel as the dawn
It fades to gray
Well, I'm half the man I used to be,
Half the man I used to be
Feelin' uninspired
Think I'll start a fire
Everybody run
Bobby's got a gun
Think you're kinda neat
Then she tells me I'm a creep
Friends don't mean a thing
Guess I'll leave it up to me
Take time with a wounded hand
'Cause it likes to heal
Take time with a wounded hand
Guess I like to steal
Take time with a wounded hand
'Cause it likes to heal,
I like to steal
I'm half the man I used to be
Because I feel as the dawn
It fades to gray
I'm half the man I used to be
Because I feel as the dawn
It fades to gray
I'm half the man I used to be
Because I feel as the dawn
It fades to gray
I'm half the man I used to be,

I know you're so sad
So sad you can't cry
But i know you let go
Although you can't remember why

Your lipstick don't fit
Your strap's coming loose
You're out in the hall
Waltzing the blues

Now you hurt somewhere
They won't find a bruise
You've been learning to walk
In those dancin' shoes

I had a mama
She told me 'bout you
She said true love don't lie
You touch that woman
And the smoke won't leave your eyes

You're talking, you walk
'cause you can't refuse
Learning to walk
In those dancin' shoes

Now you hurt somewhere
They won't find a bruise
Learning to walk

You can dance
You can jive
Having the time of your live
See that girl
Watch that scene
Look at the dancing queen
Friday night and the lights go down
Looking for a place to go
Where they touch the right music, entering in the swing
You come find a king
Anybody could be that guy
The night is beggining end the music is high
With a bit of rock, everything is OK
And you are ready for a dance
When you have the chance
You are the dancing queen, young and sweet
Only 17
Dancing queen and you feel the tamborim
You can dance, you can jive
Having the time of your life
See that girl, watch that scene
Look at the dancing queen

Was as real as it seemed

Of the bluebird as she sings
The six o'clock alarm would never ring

Cheer up, Sleepy Jean

Angel, everything's gonna be alright.
Angel, everything's gonna work out tonight.
Thirteen years old
Sweet as a rose
Every petal of her wafer thin.
Love will make you blind
Creep up from behind
Get you jumping out of your skin
Angel, it's sink or swim.
Deep in the heart
Deep in the heart of this place.
Deep in the heart
Deep in the heart of this place.
Door is closed behind me now
The window is sealed to shut out the light.
Green as the leaves
And the cure for the nettle sting.
Do your homework it'll work out right.
Deep in the heart
Deep in the heart of this place.
Deep in the heart
Deep in the heart of this place.
The scent of cedar
I can still see her
You can't return to the place you never left.
Angel, we'll make it work out tonight
Angel, I wanna be home tonight.
Door is closed behind me now
The window's sealed, to shut out the light
Green as the leaves the cure for the nettle sting
Do your work and you'll work out right.
Deep in the heart
Deep in the heart of this place.
Deep in the heart
Deep in the heart of this place.

Desert Of Our Love
Alright
Hand of gold in the hot day
In the door and out then
The devil in the night
I feel love's alright
Going in the cold and going in the same
Born in the love with the light again
I believe in the love
I'm up again, alright
Alright
Come there, the darkest love then
All alone in the darkest night
I'm in real love
I feel love in the song
One more verse
Meet me in the door with the desert
In the morning I am
In there in the door, in the
Feeling in the stars and the love
All the love and all in the day
Feeling in my power in my love
Say it's in all the day, all the day
Gonna be in the garden in the sky
Oh yeah
Alright
And the desert of our love
And the desert of our love
And the feeling in the sand
When the poor man then
Go in the door, door feel me
Go inside, kneel down
I feel love in the song
Chorus
Feel in the love, I love ya
Go in the soul
Bird in the sky, bird in the rain
Going the field in my heart
In my sight, believe me
Bird in the song
Love

I met my love by the gas works wall
Dreamed a dream by the old canal
Kissed a girl by the factory wall
Dirty old town
Dirty old town
Clouds a drifting across the moon
Cats a prowling on their beat
Spring's a girl in the street at night
Dirty old town
Dirty old town
Heard a siren from the docks
Saw a train set the night on fire
Smelled the spring on the smoky wind
Dirty old town
Dirty old town
I'm going to make me a good sharp axe
Shining steel tempered in the fire
Will chop you down like an old dead tree
Dirty old town
Dirty old town

You do your disappearing act
You do your disappearing act
Silence, I know I could get used to this
Cunning, your scent is something I'm not gonna miss
Exile, it's a small price to pay for bliss
Alone, like the painter's dog without a bone
When there's only one thing you need to own
And that is hunger, hunger itself
I know you'll be convinced
Your mattress ripped, and it is torn to shreds
From all the lovers taken to your beds
They're empty now
And you think that you can love
And you think that you can love
And you think that you can love someone into love
You do your disappearing act
You do your disappearing act
Jealousy, it's not what it's cracked up to be
Envy, gets you where you need to be
Alone, rather the river than your stepping stones
Leave the graveyard 'fore you turn to bones
I'm tragic, you're comedy
Oh, baby doll, the dogs are barking, they need to be fed
All the lepers you let in your head - is it empty now?
Cos you think that you can love
And you think that you can love
And you think that you can love someone into love
You do your disappearing act
You do your disappearing act

We’re gonna sink but you can swim
If you don’t mind a little change of skin
Designer genes are a better fit
‘Cause we can be what we wanna be
And we need to be what we gotta be
And that’s what we oughta be

Cause we can be what we wanna be
Tomorrow belongs to the brave
And we need to be what we gotta be
Not the slave but the brave
Do it yourself
Do it yourself
Diy world
Rising seas, no more trees
Then be a freaking fleet of killer bees
We’re masters of creation
Dna is the way
Now that evolution’s had its day
The intelligent design solution
And we, we could live for a thousand years
‘Cause we can be what we wanna be
And we need to be what we gotta be

Imagine, we could produce super-strength
Electric reflexes
Powers once reserved for the ancient gods
Are now within our grasp
And we, we could live
We could live for a thousand years

Various lead singers = Normal, Bono = Bold]
It's Christmastime
There's no need to be afraid
At Christmastime
We let in light and we banish shade
And in our world of plenty
We can spread a smile of joy
Throw your arms around the world at Christmastime
But say a prayer
Pray for the other ones
At Christmastime
It's hard, but when you're having fun
There's a world outside your window
And it's a world of dread and fear
Where the only water flowing is
The bitter sting of tears
And the Christmas bells that ring there
Are the clanging chimes of doom
Well tonight thank God it's them instead of you
And there won't be snow in Africa this Christmastime
The greatest gift they'll get this year is life
Where nothing ever grows
No rain nor rivers flow
Do they know it's Christmastime at all?
Here's to you / Raise a glass for everyone
Here's to them / Underneath that burning sun
Do they know it's Christmastime at all?
Feed the world
Feed the world
Feed the world
Let them know it's Christmastime again
Feed the world
Let them know it's Christmastime again

(feat with Andrea Corr)
You're everything I could want
There's no house you couldn't haunt
You're the key that could keep me in
You're the sense, under the skin
I won't bring you roses
I'll bring myself instead
Time only is time
For what is meant
Not what was said
Don't come knocking, don't come knocking
Don't come knocking at my door
Don't come knocking, knock, knock, knocking
Don't come knocking no more
You're a dream I could wake up in
You're a fight I shouldn't try to win
You're the door, I'll always leave open
You're the heart that's always hopin'
Off a tree-lined avenue, in a college made of stone
I'll sit there not dreaming, I would rather live alone
Don't come knocking, don't come knocking
Don't come knocking at my door
Don't come knocking, knock, knock, knocking
Don't come knocking no more
All the stars in the sky
They can't light our way, oh no
All the maps, and all the charts
All the dreams…
Dreams …won't… leave… you…
Home…
Home…
Don't come knocking, don't come knocking
Don't come knocking at my door
Don't come knocking, don't come knocking
Don't come knocking at my door
Don't come knocking, knock, knock, knocking
Don't come knocking no more

I can't be your weather
Cuz' if it rains then it rains
I can't be your lover
Cuz' the feelings would change
I can't be the wind
Cuz' the wind blows too free
But if you want a true companion
Don't forget about me
Don't forget about me
When your heart's in the shade
When there's no one to hold you
And you've fallen from grace
When the spotlights come blind you
And you can no longer see
I'll be right there beside you
Don't forget about me
Friends never leave you
They're a two way street
They'll always believe in you
When you've ceased to believe
And I'll still feel the same
If you're a friend in need

In this proud land we grew up strong
We were wanted all along
I was taught to fight, taught to win
I never thought I could fail
No fight left or so it seems
I am a man whose dreams have all deserted
I've changed my face, I've changed my name
But no one wants you when you lose
Don't give up 'cause you have friends
Don't give up, you're not beaten yet
Don't give up, I know you can make it good
Though I saw it all around
Never thought I could be affected
Thought that we would be last to go
It's so strange the way things turn
Drove the night toward my home
The place that I was born, out on the lakeside
As daylight broke I saw the earth
The trees had burned down to the ground
Don't give up, you still have us
Don't give up, we don't need much of anything
Don't give up 'cause somewhere there's a place where we belong
Rest your head, you worry too much
It's going to be all right
When times get rough you can fall back on us
Don't give up, please don't give up
Got to walk out of here
I can't take any more
Going to stand on that bridge
Keep my eyes down below
Whatever may come
Whatever may go
That river's flowing
That river's flowing
Don't give up 'cause you have friends
Don't give up, you're not the only one
Don't give up, there's no reason to be ashamed
Don't give up, you still, you still have us
I believe, you and me
That somewhere there's a place where we belong
Af-ri-ca
Af-ri-ca

A young boy named Billy Joe, restless on the farm
A boy filled with wanderlust, who never really meant no harm
He changed his clothes and he shined his boots
And he combed his dark hair down
But his mama cried as he walked out:
'Don't take your guns to town
Don't take your guns to town
Don't take your guns... to town'
He laughed and kissed his mom and said 'Your Billy Joe he's the man
I can shoot as quick, I can shoot as straight, as anybody, can
But I wouldn't shoot, without a cause, or gun nobody down'
But she cried again as he rode away:
'Don't take your guns to town
Son, leave your guns at home
Don't take your guns to town'
Well he drank his first strong liquor then to calm his shaking hands
And he tried, he tried to tell himself at last he had become a man
But a dusty cowpoke stood at his side, began to laugh him down
And he heard again his mother's words:
'Don't take your guns to town
Son, leave your guns at home
Don't take your guns...'
Don't take your guns....
Don't take your guns to town
Don't take your guns....
Don't take your guns to town
Filled with rage then Billy Joe reached for his gun to draw
But the stranger drew his gun and fired before he even saw
As Billy Joe fell to the floor the crowd all gathered around
And wondered at his final words:
'Don't take your guns to town
Son, leave your guns at home
Don't take your guns to town'

My eyes are black
They've seen the glory
My ears are shut
They've heard the storm
My legs are weak
From so much stumbling
Down all the days
Down all the days
My lips are dry
They've tasted water
My spirit high
I hardly touch the ground
My heart is heavy
It hears the distant firing
Down all the days
Down all the days
Down all the days
Down all the days
Down all the days
Days, days
Down all the days
Days, days
I love to talk
Days, days
Can you leave me some it to hug
Days, days
Can you hold me now
Days, days
I love her hug
Days, days
Days, days
Days
The skyline's in the cloud
Throw down some winds now
Right now I'm only here to see me
Come down whenever you want to see me
Right on a phone, the holy rose
Someone in the street's on fire
And I am weary, worthy
Wounded, all wrong
I love thee, to hold thee
I love thee

My heart is longing for you, love
I cared for you more then you knew
Though you have broken each promise
And yesterday's dreams are untrue
Alone, I'll be yearning tomorrow
When sunshine brings memories of you
My sunshine will turn into sorrow
As I dream of the love we once knew
Why should I always be lonesome
When sunny and blue are the skies
While shadows and loneliness linger
I'm dreaming with tears in my eyes
Why did you promise me sweetheart
Never to leave me alone
Yesterday's sunshine is faded
Your love wasn't true like my own
Alone, I'll be yearning tomorrow
When sunshine brings memories of you
My sunshine will turn into sorrow
As I dream of the love we once knew
Why should I always be lonesome
When sunny and blue are the skies
While shadows of loneliness linger
I'm dreaming with tears in my eyes

I met her up on Leeson Street of a Tuesday afternoon
In Summer's fallen colours, sulking back to school
I asked her would she linger, I asked her would she stay
Would she keep a man in company, drinking in the day?
Drinking, Drinking
Drinking... not thinking
Drinking, Drinking
We'll go drinking in the day
She was almost a woman, she was going on sixteen
She asked me to go walking, In Saint Stephen's Green
She said I love the sunshine, and to hear the children play.
But I won't be distracted when I'm drinking in the day.
With her flashing eyes and milk white lies she looked like a song
Like the ghost of a woman that first made me go wrong
She said I'll have a drink with you I said you'll have to pay
For a comprehensive education
Drinking in the day
Drinking, Drinking
Drinking and not thinking
Drinking, Drinking
We'll go drinking in the day
If her mother could have seen us on that bright September day
Botticelli and his angel perambulating Ormand Quay
A drunken blessed virgin, me rhetorious and gay
Bestowing ancient wisdom as to what made me this way
Deny your friends and family
To serve you must betray
Break and enter heaven
S teal but never save
Squander every penny
Empty every heart
Travel every darkened road
Never finish what you start
Always talk to strangers
Make love with whom you may
For God will find good company
for your drinking in the day
Drinking, drinking
Drinking and not thinking
Drinking, drinking
We'll go drinking in the day
So spend your youth on poetry, and spend your cash at play
Each line upon my face is for a girl who went away
A kiss, a song, are fleeting things and fame will always stray
So I'll tell the truth, the best spent youth, is the one you give away
Drinking, drinking
Drinking... not thinking
Drinking, drinking
We'll go drinking in the day
Drinking, drinking
Drinking... not thinking
Drinking, drinking
We'll go drinking in the day
Drinking, drinking
Drinking... not thinking
Drinking, drinking
We'll go drinking in the day
Drinking, drinking
Drinking... not thinking
Drinking, drinking
We'll go drinking in the day
Drinking, drinking
Drinking... not thinking
Drinking, drinking
We'll go drinking in the day
Drinking, drinking
Drinking... not thinking
Drinking...

Merry Christmas. This is Bono the singer with U2.
This is a poem I'd like to, recite for you by another Irishman, John F. Dean
It's about driving to midnight mass in Dublin on Christmas Eve:
Five-thousand million years ago, this earth lay heaving in a mass of rocks and fire
Wasting, burdened with its emptiness
Tonight, when arthropods and worms and sponges have given way to dinosaurs
And dinosaurs to working, wandering apes
Homo erectus have given way to sapiens, and he to
Homo sapiens sapiens (alias Paddy Mack)
Look down on Dublin from the hills around
And lights could be a million Christmas trees
Still firs standing, while in the sky a glow as if of dawn
This day a light shall shine on us
The Lord is born within our city
Look along to the river toward O'Connell Bridge
The lights, the neon signs, all stream on water like breathed-on strips of tinsel
All is still...
Eleven-thirty, pubs begin to empty
Men stop to argue, sway and say the name of Jesus
For those who have known darkness
Who have now seen a wonderous light
Those who have dwelt on unlit streets
To them the light has come
Tonight, few cars go by
The blocks of flats with windowed-plastic trees
And fairy lights stand, watching for a miracle
Here are no dells where fairies might appear
Out from the dark an ambulance comes speeding
Sickly blue lights search in siren-still
The mystery of the night ticks slowly on
It will pass and leave memories of friends and small, half-welcomed things
In Him was life
In Him, life was the light of man
For neither prehistoric swans nor trilobites, the mesozoic birds
Neanderthal, nor modern man had ever dreamt or seen what was our God
The shops are gay with lights and bright things
All save funeral homes, they dare not advertise their presence
As midnight peels and organs start to play
Two cars meet headlong in a haze of drink
The crash flicks into silence
Pain crawls like a slime through blood and into limbs
God is revealed, a baby naked, crying in a crib
In the church porches and out along the grounds
Teenagers laugh and swear, smokin', watchin' girls
So, once more, Christmas trails away
Its meaning moves back into the mist and the march of time

America
America, I've given you all and now I'm nothing
America, two dollars and twenty-seven cents January 17, 1956
I can't stand my own mind
America, when will we end the human war
Go fuck yourself with your atom bomb
I don't feel good, don't bother me
I won't write my poem till I'm in my right mind
America, when will you be angelic
When will you take off your clothes
When will you look at yourself through the grave
When will you be worthy of your million Trotskyites
America, why are your libraries full of tears
America, when will you send your eggs to India
I'm sick of your insane demands
When can I go into the supermarket and buy what I need with my good looks
America, after all, it is you and I who are perfect, not the next world
Your machinery is too much for me
You made me want to be a saint
There must be some other way to settle this argument
Burroughs is in Tangiers
I don't think he'll come back, it's sinister
Are you being sinister or is this some form of practical joke
I'm trying to come to the point
I refuse to give up my obsession
America, stop pushing, I know what I'm doing
America, the plum blossoms are falling
I haven't read the newspapers for months
Everyday somebody goes on trial for murder

Oh, wrap me in my country's flag, and lay me in the
cold blue sea
Let the roaring of the waves, my solemn requiem be
And I shall sleep a pleasant sleep, while storms above
their vigils keep
My Captain brave shall read for me, the service of the
silent dead
And yay shall lower me in the waves, when all the
prayers are said
And I will find my long, long home, among the billows
and the foam
Farewell my friends for many a league, we've sailed
together on the deep
Come let us shake our hands, I'll sail no more, but
shipmates wear for weep
I'm bound above, my course is run
I near the port, my voyage is done.

(Black flash)
Black flash over my own love
Tell me of my eyes
Black flash come though my own life
Telling these things
And I believe them
And I believe in you
White flash sees the sky
And it turns its side from you
She won't turn my back
And I know you turn so blue
And you know
And your sky is feeling blue
And your heart
So cold when I'm with you
And you feel
Like no one told you to
And your time is your side
And your time with me
Ah, don't talk to me
Ah, don't talk to me
Don't talk to me
You know
Like no one told you how
But you know
Though the king that howls has howled
But you feel like sentimental
But you don't care
If I just share it in your heart
(Heart...)
Hopelessly
So hopelessly
I'm breaking through for you and me
And you don't
Though no one told you to
And you found out
Where you were going, where to
You're through with me
But I know that you will be back
For more
And you know
And though no one told you so
And you know, blue sky
Like a harder shade of blue
And you walk
When you want
To let go
Me, I'm the outside, tell me fade away
Drop me down but don't break me
In your sleep
In your sleep, inside
It's in your heart and mine
Whole sea is dark
It's in your heart and mine
Sweetly, those will come
Loving is on your side walking through
So let me in your heart
Your beat is like something...
They...
Run...
See say you're sad and reach by
So say you're sad above beside
Oh stay sad above beside
So stay sad above we said
You know I don't
No one told you how
(And you don't)
(And you wipe sweat off your white brow)
And you care
And no one told you tried
And your heart
Is left out from the side
And the rain beats down
And the shame goes down
And this rain keeps on coming down
And this sky
Tonight...
You know "S" "O" "N" "G", why
You're going go join to God
You know "S" "O" "N" "G", why
Give away some him no lie
Give away some my de day no
You know
And though no one told you sky
And you feel
Like you pretend you can
You say go, you live
Go live outside of me
Don't you leave
Don't leave out part of me
Then I can feel
Like I feel before
Like I hurt now
And I see the floor
If you pick me up
Bits and pieces on this floor

Once I had fame
I was full of pride
Well, there were a lot of friends
Always by my side
But my luck ran dry
Now my friends begin to hide
Everybody loves a winner
Everybody loves a winner
When you lose, you lose alone
Everywhere I turned
There was a hello and a smile
I never thought they'd be gone
After a while
Oh, that big road ran down
And the smiles turned to frowns
Everybody loves a winner
Everybody loves a winner
But when you lose, you lose alone
Hands to heaven that I would be true
To get back that love
There's nothing I wouldn't do
But I learned and I lost
And now I paid the cost
Everybody loves a winner
Everybody loves a winner
Everybody loves a winner
But when you lose, you lose alone

Every chip from every cup
Every promise given up
Every reason that's not enough
Is falling, falling at your feet…
Every band elastic limit
Every race when there's nothing in it
Every winner that has lost their ticket
Is falling, falling at your feet…
I've come crawling, falling at your feet…
Everyone who needs a friend
Every life that has no end
Every knee not ready to bend
Is falling, falling at your feet
I've come crawling, now I'm falling at your feet…
All fall down…
All the manic days
The faces that you pull
All the x-rays not under your control
The graffiti rolling down off of your tongue
And the compromise you make for someone…
Every teenage with acne
Every face that's spoiled by beauty
Every adult tamed by duty
Are all falling at your feet…
Every foot in every face
Every cop stop that finds the grace
Every prisoner in the Maze
Every hand that needs an ace
Is falling, falling at your feet
I've come crawling, now I'm falling at your feet…
All fall down…
All the books you never read
Just started
All the meals you rushed
And never tasted…
Every eye closed by a bruise
Every player who just can't lose
Every pop star hurling abuse
Every drunk back on the booze
All falling at your feet, all falling at your feet…
All fall down…
All the information
All the big ideas
All the radio waves
On electronic seas
How to navigate
How to simply be
Don't know when to wait
Explain simplicity
In whom shall I trust?
How might I be still?
Teach me to surrender
Not my will, THY will…

Don't believe the devil
I don't believe his book
But the truth is not the same
Without the lies he made up.
Don't believe in excess
Success is to give
Don't believe in riches
But you should see where I live.
I, I believe in love.
Don't believe in forced entry
Don't believe in rape
But every time she passes by
Wild thoughts escape.
Don't believe in Death Row
Skid row or the gangs.
Don't believe in the Uzi
It just went off in my hands.
I, I believe in love.
Don't believe in cocaine
Got a speedball in my head
I could cut and crack you open
Did you hear what I said?
Don't believe them when they tell me
There ain't no cure.
The rich stay healthy
The sick stay poor.
I, I believe in love.
Don't believe in Goldman
His type like a curse
Instant karma's gonna get him
If I don't get him first.
Don't believe that Rock 'n' Roll
Can really change the world
As it spins in revolution
Yeah, it spirals and turns.
I, I believe in love.
Don't believe in the sixties
The golden age of pop
You glorify the past
When the future dries up.
Heard a singer on the radio
Late last night
Says he's gonna kick the darkness
Till it bleeds daylight.
I, I believe in love.
Feel like I'm fallin'
I'm spinnin' on a wheel
It always stops beside a name
A presence I can feel.
I believe in love.
Stop!

See reflections on the water
More than darkness in the depths
See him surface in every shadow
On the wind I feel his breath
Goldeneye
I've found his weakness
Goldeneye
He'll do what I please
Goldeneye
No time for sweetness
But a bitter kiss
Will bring him to his knees
You'll never know
How I watched you from the shadows as a child
You'll never know
How it feels to be the one who's left behind
You'll never know
The days and nights
The tears, the tears I've cried
But now my time has come
And time, time is not on your side
See him move through smoke and mirrors
Feel his presence in the crowd
Other girls, they gather around him
If I had him I wouldn't let him out
Goldeneye
Not lace or leather
Golden chains take him to the spot
Goldeneye
I'll show him forever
It'll take forever to see what I've got
You'll never know
How I watched you from the shadows as a child
You'll never know
How it feels to get so close and be denied
It's a gold and honey trap
I've got for you tonight
Revenge is a kiss
This time I won't miss
Now I've got you in my site
With a goldeneye
Golden, goldeneye
With a goldeneye
Goldeneye
Goldeneye
Goldeneye
Goldeneye

Slow is the memory
I can see it stop in my front
Flores orange crushed in concrete
I walk around, barefoot
Because I know you want me to
I can not remember everything
Your sweat is sweet taste as a stick of sugar
I had been there before coming
My tank is empty
But you are based
I have tried to explain
What I love another person
But I can not bear to hear you cry
I was sick in all those years wasted
A rag for the tears of someone
I would bring out and hang dry pra
And I saw you when I came back
Perhaps we can begin to track the back forward
You touch it because he knows how much I
I think that we need to relax
Because I know you want me to
Every time and everywhere
A superficial happiness but the belly is not there
With the bad things you really should take care
And the gap is too bear pra
I have tried to explain
What I love another person
But I can not bear to hear you cry
I was sick in all those years wasted
A rag for the tears of someone
I would bring out and hang dry pra
Come, come
Turn off the phone
Please go home

I've heard there was a secret chord
That David played to please the Lord
But you don't really care for music, do you
It goes like this: the fourth, the fifth
The minor fall, the major lift
The baffled king composed Hallelujah
Your faith was strong but you needed proof
You saw her bathing on the roof
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew you
She tied you to a kitchen chair
She broke your throne, she cut your hair
And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah
You say I took the Name in vain
Well I don't even know the name
But if I did, well, really, what's it to you
There's a blaze of light in every word
It doesn't matter which you heard
The holy, or the broken Hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah
I did my best, it wasn't much
I couldn't feel, so I learned to touch
I've told the truth, I didn't come to fool you
And even though all went wrong
I'll stand before the Lord of Song
With nothing on my lips but Hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Now maybe there's a God above
But all I ever learned from love
Was how to shoot at someone who outdrew you
And it's no complaint you hear tonight
It's not some pilgrim who's seen the light
It's a cold and broken Hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah

Happiness is a warm gun

Mother Superior jump the gun

Mother Superior jump the gun
Happiness is a warm gun
Happiness is a warm gun
She's well acquainted with the touch of the velvet hand
Like a lizard on a window pane
The man in the crowd
With the multicoloured mirrors on his hobnail boots
Lying with his eyes wide open
And the hands busy working overtime
A soap impression of his wife which he ate
And donated to the National Trust
Hey, I need a fix 'cause I'm going down
Happiness is a, a warm gun
Happiness is a, a warm gun
Happiness is a, a warm gun
Happiness is a warm gun
Happiness is a warm gun
Happiness is a warm gun
I need a fix cause I'm going down
I need a fix cause I'm going down
I need a fix cause I'm going down
To the bits that I left uptown
I need a fix cause I'm going down, uptown
Need a fix cause I'm going down, uptown
Happiness is a, a warm gun
Happiness is a, a warm gun
Happiness is a, a warm gun
Happiness is a warm gun
Happiness is a warm gun

Oh, where have you been, my blue-eyed son?
Oh, where have you been, my darling young one?
I've stumbled on the side of twelve misty mountains
I've walked and I've crawled on six crooked highways
I've stepped in the middle of seven sad forests
I've been out in front of a dozen dead oceans
I've been ten thousand miles in the mouth of a graveyard
And it's a hard, and it's a hard, it's a hard, and it's a hard
And it's a hard rain's a-gonna fall
Oh, what did you see, my blue-eyed son?
Oh, what did you see, my darling young one?
I saw a newborn baby with wild wolves all around it
I saw a highway of diamonds with nobody on it
I saw a black branch with blood that kept drippin'
I saw a room full of men with their hammers a-bleedin'
I saw a white ladder all covered with water
I saw ten thousand talkers whose tongues were all broken
I saw guns and sharp swords in the hands of young children
And it's a hard, and it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard
And it's a hard rain's a-gonna fall
And what did you hear, my blue-eyed son?
And what did you hear, my darling young one?
I heard the sound of a thunder, it roared out a warnin'
Heard the roar of a wave that could drown the whole world
Heard one hundred drummers whose hands were a-blazin'
Heard ten thousand whisperin' and nobody listenin'
Heard one person starve, I heard many people laughin'
Heard the song of a poet who died in the gutter
Heard the sound of a clown who cried in the alley
And it's a hard, and it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard
And it's a hard rain's a-gonna fall
Oh, who did you meet, my blue-eyed son?
Who did you meet, my darling young one?
I met a young child beside a dead pony
I met a white man who walked a black dog
I met a young woman whose body was burning
I met a young girl, she gave me a rainbow
I met one man who was wounded in love
I met another man who was wounded with hatred
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard
It's a hard rain's a-gonna fall
Oh, what'll you do now, my blue-eyed son?
Oh, what'll you do now, my darling young one?
I'm a-goin' back out 'fore the rain starts a-fallin'
I'll walk to the depths of the deepest black forest
Where the people are many and their hands are all empty
Where the pellets of poison are flooding their waters
Where the home in the valley meets the damp dirty prison
Where the executioner's face is always well hidden
Where hunger is ugly, where souls are forgotten
Where black is the color, where none is the number
And I'll tell it and think it and speak it and breathe it
And reflect it from the mountain so all souls can see it
Then I'll stand on the ocean until I start sinkin'
But I'll know my song well before I start singin'
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard
It's a hard rain's a-gonna fall

Need your love,

Need your love.
Like powder needs a spark
Like lies need the dark

You used to think I was something special
You haven't thought that in a while
You liked the company of my inner devil
'Cause my inner devil could make you smile
Like an angel on some stained-glass
Not some relic from the recent past
With your pale breasts and your fresh wound
And your eyes to heaven with your hands bound
I thought you'd find me when you went looking
In truth, you'd have to be there to look around
How come the honeysuckle isn't sucking
And I got a bee sting walking on the ground
Did our brass bead become a mud bath
A dirty boy, dirty girl having a dirty laugh
I saw you coming, I had you covered
Till you discovered
That we're heaven, heaven, heaven and hell
Heaven, heaven, heaven, heaven and hell
Picnick table and a china cup
We had an airbed that was all stuffed
Now it's room 64 at the chateau
Ask the front desk where does your love go
Is it to heaven, heaven, heaven or to hell
Is it to heaven, heaven, heaven or hell
Baby, we're heaven, heaven, heaven, heaven and hell

Hunters and Prey
Fly from the haze
Jump on the prey
Scaring away
Capture's in vain
Daring the hills
Mountains ahead
Roaming and stare
Lonely again
Perish the heat
Succumbing breath
Last but not least
Die or slay
Hide on the field
Perceiving eyes
Hunting the prey
In paradise
No one is to know
Secrets of your soul
No one knows for sure
Still I wonder why
I'm waiting, just waiting
Answers to return
Don't let your dreams deny you
When it's time to learn
I'm standing, I'm waiting
Time has no reverse
Can someone see them falling
Bones will feed the dirt
Hunters and Prey
You got to run away!

See how they fly like lucy in the sky
See how they run
I'm crying (4x)
Yellow matter custard
Dripping from a dead dog's eye
Crab a locker fishwife
Pornographic priestess
Boy, you've been a naughty girl
You let your knickers down
Refrão
Sitting in an english garden, waiting for the sun
If the sun don't come you get a tan
From standing in the english rain
Refrão
Expert texperts choking smokers
Don't you think the joker laughts at you?
See how they smile like pigs in a sty
See how they snide
I'm crying
Semolina pilchard
Climbing up the eiffel tower
Elementary penguin
Singin' hare krishna
Man, you should have seen them
Kicking Edgar Allan Poe
I am the eggman
They are the eggmen
I am the walrus
Goo goo g'joob

They said there'll be snow at Christmas
They said there'll be peace on Earth
But instead it just kept on raining
A veil of tears for the Virgin's birth
I remember one Christmas morning
A winters light and a distant choir
And the peal of a bell and that Christmas Tree smell
And their eyes full of tinsel and fire
They sold me a dream of Christmas
They sold me a Silent Night
And they told me a fairy story
'Till I believed in the Israelite
And I believed in Father Christmas
And I looked at the sky with excited eyes
'Till I woke with a yawn in the first light of dawn
And I saw him and through his disguise
I wish you a hopeful Christmas
I wish you a brave New Year
All anguish pain and sadness
Leave your heart and let your road be clear
They said there'll be snow at Christmas
They said there'll be peace on Earth
Hallelujah Noel be it Heaven or Hell
The Christmas you get you deserve.
La la la la la la la la la la....

Say it now, say it now
Explain to me
Why this happens to me every time
Give me any kind of sign
‘Cause I just can’t walk away
You wait
I won’t
I leave
I don’t
I memorize what I have to say
But he doesn’t say it anyway
Say it now, say it now
Explain to me
Why this happens to me every time
Give me a clue or tell me why
I just can’t walk away
Walk, walk away
Walk, walk away
Needing, aching, lying awake
In a room in my heart
A heartbeat away
Yet we’re miles apart
You know that love can’t live
Without honesty
But there are dangers in the daylight
And the shadows with me
Say it now, I wish I could say it now
Say to me the words I need to hear
Why you just don’t disappear
And why I just can’t walk way
Say it now, say it now
Say to me the simple words I fear
I know why I’m here
‘Cause I just can’t walk away
Walk, walk away
Walk, walk away
Walk, walk away
Walk, walk away
Walk, walk away
Walk, walk away
Walk, walk away
Walk, walk away

I was talking, I was talking to myself
Somebody else talk, talk, talking.
I couldn't hear a word, a word he said.
He was my brother
I said there was no other way out of here
Be my brother
(Brother).
Got to get out, got to get out.
I was walking, I was walking into walls
And back again
I just keep walking
I walk up to a window to see myself
And my reflection, when I thought about it
My direction, going nowhere, going nowhere.
No-one, no-one is blinder
Than he who will not see.
No-one, no-one is blinder
Than me.
I was talking, I was talking in my sleep
I can't stop talk, talk, talking
I'm talking to you, it's up to you
Be my brother, there is no other way out of here
Be my brother
Got to get out, got to get out
Got to get out of here.

I have got you under my skin
I've got you deep in the heart of me
So deep in my heart
You're really a part of me
I've got you under my skin
I have tried so not to give in
I have said to myself this affair
Never gonna go so well
But why should I try to resist
When baby I know so well
That I've got you under my skin
I would sacrifice anything
Come what might
For the sake of holding you near
In spite of a warning voice
That comes in the night
And repeats and it shouts in my ear
Don't you know blue-eyes
You never can win
Use your mentality
Wake up to reality
But each time I do
Just the thought of you
Makes me stop before I begin
'cause I've got you under my skin
I'd sacrifice anything
Come what might
For the sake of having you near
In spite of a warning voice
That comes in the night
And repeats and it shouts in my ear
Don't you know you fool
You never can win
Use your mentality
Wake up to reality
But each time that I do
Just the thought of you
Makes me stop before I begin
'cause I've got you under my skin
And I love you (when you're) under my skin

"In the Name of the Father"
Come to me
Come lie beside me
Oh don't deny me
Your love
Make sense of me
Walk through my doorway
Don't hide in the hallway
Oh love...step over
I'll follow you down
I'll follow you down
In the name of whiskey
In the name of song
You didn't look back
You didn't belong
In the name of reason
In the name of hope
In the name of religion
In the name of dope
In the name of freedom
You drifted away
To see the sun shining
On someone else's day
In the name of United and the BBC
In the name of Georgie Best and LSD
In the name of a father
And his wife the spirit
You said you did not
They said you did it
In the name of justice
In the name of fun
In the name of the father
In the name of the son
Call to me
No one is listening
I'm waiting to hear from you love
Stay with me
It's cold in the ground
But there's peace in the sound
Of the white and the black
Spilling over
I'll follow you down
I'll follow you down

Hard to tell or recognise a sign
To see me through, a warning sign
First the thunder
Satisfied
If the past, it will not lie
Then the storm, torn assunder
The future you and i get blown away
In the storm
In a lifetime
In a lifetime
And as the rain it falls, begin again
As the storm breaks through
Heavy in my heart
Believe the light in you
So the light shines in you
Without colour, faded and worn
Torn assunder in the storm
Unless the sound has faded from your soul
Unless it dissapears
First the thunder
Selfish storm
Then the storm
Hold on the inside
Torn assunder
One life
In the storm
In a lifetime
In a lifetime
In a lifetime
In a lifetime

In the ocean cuts ring deep, the sky
Like there, I don't know why
In the forest there's a clearing
I run there towards the light
Sky, it's a blue sky
In the earth the hole deep, deep, decide
If I could I would
Up for air to swim against the tide
Hey, hey, hey
Up towards the sky
It's a blue sky
To lose along the way the spark that set the flame
To flicker and to fade on this the longest day
So wind go through to my heart
So wind blow through my soul
So wind go through to my heart
So wind blow through my soul
So wind go through to my heart
You give yourself to this the longest day
You give yourself, you give it all away
Two rivers run too deep, the seasons change and so do I
The light that strikes the tallest trees the light away for I
The light away, up towards the sky
It's a blue sky
To lose along the way the spark that set the flame
To flicker and to fade on this the longest day
So wind go through to my heart
So wind blow through my soul
So wind go through to my heart
So wind blow through my soul
So wind go through my heart
So wind blow through my soul
So wind go through to my heart

For a thousand years

Can't go on

Take your time feel fine

I saw an angel in blue jeans today
I felt that she melted all my bitterness away
You always tried so hard to hide your wings behind your coat
So let it be and let them free
So you can't hoover low above the ground
You look so tired you've got moonbeams in your eyes
And if I believed I know you'd be the first to fly
You always tried so hard to hide your wings behind your coat
So let it be and let them free
So you can't hoover low above the ground
I'll find sunshine sometime soon

Ma jolie, how do you do?
Mon nom est Jean-Guy Thibault-Leroux
I come from east of Gatineau
My name is Jean-Guy, ma jolie
J'ai une maison a Lafontaine
Where we can live, if you marry me
Une belle maison a Lafontaine
Where we will live, you and me
Oh Louise, ma jolie Louise
Tous les matins au soleil
I will work 'til work is done
Tous les matins au soleil
I did work 'til work was done
And one day, the foreman said
"Jean-Guy, we must let you go"
Et pis mon nom, y est pas bon
At the mill anymore...
Oh Louise, I'm losing my head
I'm losing my head
My kids are small, 4 and 3
Et la bouteille, she's mon ami
I drink the rum 'tilI I can't see
It hides the shame Louise does not see
Carousel turns in my head
And I can't hide, oh no, no, no, no
And the rage turned in my head
And Louise, I struck her down
Down on the ground
I'm losing my mind, I'm losing my mind
En Septembre '63
Kids are gone, and so is Louise
Ontario, they did go
Near la ville de Toronto
Now my tears, they roll down
Tous les jours
And I remember the days
And the promises that we made
Oh Louise, ma jolie Louise, ma jolie Louise

[English Translation Below]
Gorgeous, how do you do?
My name is Jean-Guy Thibault-Leroux

My name is Jean-Guy, my beautiful
I've got a house in Lafontaine
Where we can live, if you marry me
A beatiful house in Lafontaine
Where we will live, you and me
Oh Louise, my beautiful Louise
Every sunny morning
I will work 'til work is done
Every sunny morning
I did work 'til work was done
And one day, the foreman said
"Jean-Guy, we must let you go"
And then my name, it's not good there
At the mill anymore...
Oh Louise, I'm losing my head
I'm losing my head
My kids are small, 4 and 3
And the bottle is my friend
I drink the rum 'til I can't see
It hides the shame Louise does not see
Carousel turns in my head,
And I can't hide, oh no, no, no, no
And the rage turned in my head
And Louise, I struck her down
Down on the ground
I'm losing my mind I'm losing my mind
In September '63
Kids are gone, and so is Louise
Ontario, they did go
Near the city of Toronto
Now my tears, they roll down

Oh joy, love you bring
Oh joy, make my heart sing
And I drove across the desert
I was in my four wheel drive
I was looking for the Buddha
Then I saw Jesus Christ
He smiled and shrugged his shoulders
And he lit a cigarette
Said jump for joy, make some noise
Remember what I said
My soul is a like a ruby
And I threw it in the earth
But now my hands are bleeding
From scrabbling in the dirt
And I look up to the heavens
And a light is on my face
I never never never thought
I'd find a state of grace
Hey joy, love you bring
Oh joy, make my heart sing
Oh joy, joy in everything
Joy joy joy oh joy
Joy joy joy oh joy
I was drowning in the darkness
As I drove down to the sea
Joy joy joy oh joy
And I looked up to the mountain
And the light burst over me
Joy joy joy oh oh joy
You make me sing
Oh joy, the love you bring
Oh joy, you make me sing
Oh joy, in everything
Joy joy joy oh joy
In everything
In everything
Jump for joy
Jump for joy
Jump for joy
Jump for joy
Jump for joy
Jump for joy
You make me sing
The love you bring
In everything

The rangers had a homecoming in harlem late last night
And the magic rat drove his sleek machine over the jersey state line
Barefoot girl sitting on the hood of a dodge
Drinking warm beer in the soft summer rain
The rat pulls into town rolls up his pants
Together they take a stab at romance and disappear down flamingo lane
Well the maximum lawman run down
Flamingo chasing the rat and the barefoot, girl
And the kids round here look just like shadows always quiet, holding hands
From the churches to the jails tonight all is silence in the world
As we take our stand down in jungleland
The midnight gang's assembled and picked a rendezvous for the night
They'll meet `neath that giant exxon sign that brings this fair city light
Man there's an opera out on the turnpike
There's a ballet being fought out in the alley
Until the local cops, cherry tops, rips this holy night
The street's alive as secret debts are paid
Contacts made, they vanished unseen
Kids flash guitars just like switch-blades hustling for the record machine
The hungry and the hunted explode into rock'n'roll bands
That face off against each other out in the street down in jungleland
In the parking lot the visionaries dress in the latest rage
Inside the backstreet girls are dancing to the records that the d.j. Plays
Lonely-hearted lovers struggle in dark corners
Desperate as the night moves on, just a look and a whisper, and they're gone
Beneath the city two hearts beat
Soul engines running through a night so tender in a bedroom locked
In whispers of soft refusal and then surrender in the tunnels uptown
The rat's own dream guns him down
As shots echo down them hallways in the night
No one watches when the ambulance pulls away
Or as the girl shuts out the bedroom light
Outside the street's on fire in a real death waltz
Between flesh and what's fantasy and the poets down here
Don't write nothing at all, they just stand back and let it all be
And in the quick of the night they reach for their moment
And try to make an honest stand but they wind up wounded, not even dead
Tonight in jungleland

There are colors on the street
Oh, red, white, and blue
People shufflin' their feet
People sleepin' in their shoes
[You got endure]
A warnin' sign in the road ahead
There's a lot of people sayin' we'd be better off dead
I don't feel like satan, but I am to them
So I try to forgive 'em any way I can
Keep on rockin' in the free world
Keep on rockin' in the free world
Keep on rockin' in the free world
Keep on rockin' in the free world
There's a girl in the night
With a baby in her hand
Under an old street light
Oh, next to a garbage can
Oh, now she put her kid away, she's gone to get a hit
She hates her life, and what she's done with it
That's one more kid that'll never be cool
Never get to fall in love, never get to be him
Keep on rockin' in the free world
Keep on rockin' in the free world
Keep on rockin' in the free world
Keep on rockin' in the free world
Sadness in the culture, man
You know, you, don't you want to say
Got to feelin' like I'm, like I'm,
Like I'm on my way
Girls, I want you to all say what to feel
Got the manacle, man, of voice and steel
Got the flaxen locks
He got the eyes of clocks
I wish him stay up on the boat until he kill the jocks
I got the super soul
He got the man of steel
He got the higher with the feeling in the meanest feel
Keep on rockin' in the free world
(Stay/keep on)
It would be difficult to work harder than that man
Keepin' us in a free world, that's all I'm gonna say
There's a thousand points of light
For the african man
There's a kinder, gentler,
Coming-to-help-you hand
There's department stores and toilet paper
Styrofoam garbage for the ozone layer
There's a fan of the people, he's standin' on their side
He's got fuel to burn, he's got roads to drive
Keep on rockin' in the free world
Keep on rockin' in the free world
Keep on rockin' in the free world
Keep on rockin' in the free world
A song that needs to understand
I'm here to see pearl jam
They're givin' people 'lieving again
I never say never again
They're makin' me believer again
They rock, rock, rock
Rock, rock, rock, rock
Rock, rock, rock, rock
-N-roll, roll, roll, roll
Roll, roll, roll
Thank you
Thank you, sir
Love ya

[Bono]
While like a giant - proud and happy
I take my baby in my arms
Fragile, innocent and alive
And like a little bird he's
Pushing against my chest
Abandoned quiet and safe
For an instant almost sweetly
My destiny appears to me like a dream
And I see myself, old and surrendered,
Seated there near the coalfire
Waiting for the evening with the anxiety of a child,
Just to see him coming back home
With the gift of his smile
Of his words and kindness
It's like a promise that can solve the enormous joy
Of one of his caresses.
Then I wake up and I've already forgotten
But inside of me the kid's trapped soul advises me
That this new born child is already more important to me
Than that of my own life […]
[Bocelli]
[…] e restai davanti a lui per un po'
e ascoltai nell'aria poi l'afferai
Lui aprì la mano e poi
mi toccò il naso sfiorò la bocca
Io l'abbracciai ed il mondo girò di più
Intorno a noi ogni cosa poi fiorì
E restai davanti a lui per un po'
E fu li che il tempo ci ritrovò
Lui aprì la mano e poi mi toccò il naso
ed io sorrisi
Io l'abbracciai ed il mondo girò di più
Intorno a noi ogni cosa poi fiorì
Il mondo è un puntino di luce blu
Che gira e va con
il soffio degli angeli
Io l'abbracciai ed il mondo girò di più
Che gira e va con
il soffio degli angeli
Io l'abbracciai e restai così, così
[Translation of above Italian]
[...] and I stood in front of him for a while
And listened to the air and then held him
He opened his hand and then
touched my nose and brushed my mouth
I held him and the world turned more
Around us everything blossomed
I stood still for awhile
And it was there that time found us again
He opened his hand then touched my nose
and I smiled
I held him and the world turned more
Around us everything blossomed
The world is a tiny point of blue light
That turns and moves with
the breath of angels
I held him and the world turned more
That turns are moves with
the breath of angels
I held him and stood just so, just so…

When I find myself in times of trouble
Mother mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be
And in my hour of darkness
She is standing right in front of me
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be
And when the broken hearted people
Living in the world agree
There will be an answer, let it be
For though they may be parted there is
Still a chance that they will see
There will be an answer, let it be
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be, yeah

There is still a light that shines on me
Shine on until tomorrow, let it be

Mother mary comes to me

Yes, there was silence
Yes, there was no people here
Yes, I walked through the streets of Dublin
And no-one was near
Yes, I don’t know you
No, I didn’t think I didn’t care
You live so very far away from just across the square
And I can’t reach but I can ring
You can’t touch but you can, you can sing
Across rooftops
Sing down the phone
Sing and promise me you won’t stop
Sing your love, be known
Let your love be known
Yes, there is isolation
You and me, we’re still here
Yes, when we open our eyes we will stare down the fear
And maybe I’ve said the wrong thing
Yes, I made you smile
I guess the longest distance is always the last mile
And I can’t reach but I can ring
You can’t touch but you can, you can sing
Across rooftops
Sing to me down the phone
Sing and promise me you won’t stop
Sing and you’re never alone
Sing as an act of resistance
Sing, though your heart is overthrown
Sing, when you sing there is no distance
So let your love be known
Oh, let your love be known
Though your heart is overthrown
Let your love be known

It's in your voice
I can feel it I can tell
It's in your voice
Has me ringing me like a bell
Peace of mind
Peace comes dropping slow
I'm in the mind to let go of control
Spirit come on down
No I'm not coming down
In the backstreets
In the backstreets of our love
Through the locked doors
Deep down deep down is not enough
Spirit come on down no I'm not coming down
Who can stop us now
It's much too late
Can't slow us down
We can't hesitate
I want a love that's hard
As hard as hate
Levitate
To be the bee
To be the bee and the flower
Before the sweetness
Before the sweetness turns to sour
When freedom comes
Freedom has a scent
It's like the top of a new born baby's head
Baby we can taste it
You and I
Spirit come on down
No I'm not coming down
Who can stop us now
Who could make us wait
Who could slow us down
Make us hesitate
I want a love that's hard
As hard as hate

Lift me up
Spirit come on down

Heard of a van that is loaded with weapons
Packed up and ready to go
Heard of some gravesites, out by the highway
A place where nobody knows
The sound of gunfire, off in the distance
I’m getting used to it now
Lived in a brownstore, lived in the ghetto
I’ve lived all over this town
This ain’t no party, this ain’t no disco
This ain’t no fooling around
No time for dancing, or lovey dovey
I ain’t got time for that now
Transmit the message, to the receiver
Hope for an answer some day
I got three passports, a couple of visas
You don’t even know my real name
High on a hillside, the trucks are loading
Everything’s ready to roll
I sleep in the daytime, I work in the nightime
I might not ever get home
This ain’t no party, this ain’t no disco
This ain’t no fooling around
This ain’t no mudd club, or c. b. g. b
I ain’t got time for that now
Heard about houston? heard about detroit?
Heard about pittsburgh, p. a.?
You oughta know not to stand by the window
Somebody might see you up there
I got some groceries, some peant butter
To last a couple of days
But I ain’t got no speakers, ain’t got no
Heaphones, ain’t got no records to play
Why stay in college? why go to night school?
Gonna be different this time
Can’t write a letter, can’t send a postcard
I can’t write nothing at all
This ain’t no party, this ain’t no disco
This ain’t no fooling around
I’d like to kiss you, I’d love you hold you
I ain’t got no time for that now
Trouble in transit, got through the roadblock
We blended with the crowd
We got computer, we’re tapping pohne lines
I know that ain’t allowed
We dress like students, we dress like housewives
Or in a suit and a tie
I changed my hairstyle, so many times now
I don’t know what I look like!
You make me shiver, I feel so tender
We make a pretty good team
Don’t get exhausted, I’ll do some driving
You ought to get some sleep
Get you instructions, follow directions
Then you should change your address
Maybe tomorrow, maybe the next day
Whatever you think is best
Burned all my notebooks, what good are
Notebooks? they won’t help me survive
My chest is aching, burns like a furnace
The burning keeps me alive
Try to stay healthy, physical fitness
Don’t want to catch no disease
Try to be careful, don’t take no chances
You better watch what you say

Here she comes like a child with a gun
She makes you feel like you're the only one
She smiles and it's dangerous...in a little black dress
Superman and the filthy rich
Get in the queue to scratch her itch
Sticky fingers pulling at the hem
Of her little black dress
Baby don't mind
She can leave it behind
She don't want anything
Baby's a star, she's gotta keep on shining
She moves like an animal
The women sigh "It's Political"
You could get arrested around here
For that little black dress
Not so simple, it's complicated...
All this being loved and hated
I wanna know what else she's hiding
In that little black dress
Baby don't mind

Ten years ago on a cold dark night
There was someone was killed 'neath the town hall light
Just a few at the scene, and they all did agree
That the man who ran looked a lot like me
Well the judge said, "Son, what is your alibi?
If you were somewhere else, well you don't have to die"
But I spoke not a word, though it meant my life
I'd been in the arms of my best friend's wife
She walks these hills in a long black veil
She visits my grave when the night winds wail
Nobody knows Lord, nobody sees
Nobody knows but me
Well the scaffold's is high and eternity near
She stands in the crowd and sheds not a tear
But sometimes at night when the cold winds moans
In a long black veil she cries all over my bones
She walks these hills in a long black veil
She visits my grave when the night winds wail
Nobody knows Lord, nobody sees
Nobody knows but me
Nobody knows but me, yeah

I'm a rolling stone all alone and lost
For a life of sin I have paid the cost
When I pass by all the people say
Just another guy on the lost highway
Just a deck of cards and a jug of wine
And a woman's laugh makes a life like mine
The day we met, I went astray
I started down that lost highway
Just like to thank you for being with us tonight
We love you and we know you love us, too
And it's great to know that in Los Angeles it's love, not money, that makes the world go around. Hallelujah
Everybody say amen, amen.
I was just a lad, nearly twenty-two
Neither good nor bad, just a kid like you
But now I'm lost, too late to pray
Lord I take a cost, on the lost highway
Last verse
Boys, don't start to ramblin' round
On this road of sin are you sorrow bound
Take my advice or you'll curse the day
You started down that lost highway
Amen, amen

Judith? judith?)
(can you hear me?)
(can you see me?)
Life on a distant planet
Another atmosphere
Life on a distant planet
So cold inside of here
You can see her
But she can't see you
You can call her name
But she won't even hear you
In the morning of the day
To the evening
D-day and beyond
Lost on a silent planet
Two lone, rising stars
Locked on a silent planet
So close and yet so far
Children scream and shout
Their eyes torn out
Judith turns around and stumbles
To the ground
In the morning of the day
The evening time
D-day and beyond
Oh...girl you fall out
Oh...girl you come out to cry
Have you nothing to say
Girl you come out to cry
Have you nothing to say
In the morning
On to the day time
To the evening

When routine bites hard and ambitions are low
And resentment rides high but emotions won't grow
And we're changing our ways taking different roads
Then love, love will tear us apart again
Love, love will tear us apart again
Why is the bedroom so cold
You've turned away on your side
Is my timing that flawed, our respect run so dry?
Yet there's still this appeal
That we've kept through our lives
Love, love will tear us apart again
Love, love will tear us apart again
Do you cry out in your sleep
All my failings exposed
There's a taste in my mouth
As desperation takes hold
Just that something so good
Just can't function no more
When love, love will tear us apart again
Love, love will tear us apart again

Nothing worth taking so I never really took
Nothing was shaking but baby you really shook
No one was waking until you kept me up
If your heart was breaking you know I won't see you stuck
The pain never felt so good
To feel so bad
I love you
I love you like mad
I love you
I love you like mad
No one worth knowing has ever known a thing
No one who knew how could ever teach the world to sing
You are the only one I've ever listened to
So don't wait for me to ask, tell me what to do
The pain never felt so good
To feel so bad
I love you
I love you like mad
Love you
I love you like mad
Love
Love you like mad
Don't worry baby if you're in the spotlight
I'll do the maximum time for you tonight
You know that we're not crazy
Well maybe just a touch
Some sweet delight usher the rush
And some gets us close too much
I love you
I love you like mad
Love you
I love you like mad
Love you
Love you like mad
Love you
Love you like mad
Hey hey hey

Love you, love you like mad
Love you, love you like mad

No, I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more

Fold my hands and pray for rain

It's a shame the way she makes me scrub the floor
I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more

No, I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more
Well, he puts his cigar
Out in your face just for kicks

The National Guard stands around his door
Ah, I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more
No, I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more
Well, she talks to all the servants
About man and God and law
Everybody says
She's the brains behind pa
She's sixty-eight, but she says she's fifty-four
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more
I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more
No, I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more
Well, I try my best
To be just like I am
But everybody wants you
To be just like them
They say sing while you slave and I just get bored

When I look in your eyes
Your silence
Whispering misunderstandings
There's so much you need to realize

When you refuse me
You confuse me
What makes you think I'll let you in again
Think again my friend
Go on misuse me and abuse me
I'll come out stronger in the end
And does it make you sad
To find yourself alone
And does it make you mad
To find that I have grown
I'll bet it hurts so bad
To see the strength that I have shown
When you answer the door pick up the phone
You wont find me cause I'm not coming home
You do not know how much this hurts me
To say these things that I don't want to say
But have to say them anyway
I would do anything to end your suffering
But you would rather walk away

And does it make you sad

Weather 'round here choppin' and changin'
Surgery in the air
Print shirts and southern accents
Cigars and big hair.
We got the wheels, petrol's cheap
We only went there for a week
Got the sun, got the sand
Got the batteries and the handicam.
Her eyes all swimming pool blue
Dumb-bells on the diving board
Baby's always attracted to
The things she's afraid of.
Big girl with a sweet tooth watches
Skinny girl in the photo shoot.
Freshmen, squeaky-clean she tastes of chlorine.
Miami, my mammy.
Love the movies, babe
Love to walk through movie sets
Get to shoot someone in the foot
Get to smoke some cigarettes.
No big deal, we know the score
Just back from the video store.
Got the car and the car chase.
What's he got inside that case?
I want a close-up of that face.
Here comes the car chase.
I bought two new suits
Miami
Pink and blue
Miami
I took a picture of you
My mammy
Getting hot in a photo booth
Miami.
I said you looked like a madonna.
You said maybe.
You said I wanna have your baby, baby.
We could make something beautiful
Something that wouldn't be a problem
We could make something beautiful
Something that wouldn't be a problem
Least not in Miami.
You know, some places are like your auntie
But there's no place like Miami
My mammy
Miami
My mammy.

There is a light bright enough to make us blind
Yeah I'm a straying man, Lord I got no plan

Perso nel vivere profondo

Running from you, running from love
You give me so much to hold on

The Mother of God
It's... this is by William Butler Yeats:
The threefold terror of love; a fallen flare
Through the hollow of an ear;
Wings beating about the room;
The terror of all terrors that I bore
The Heavens in my womb.
Had I not found content among the shows
Every common woman knows,
Chimney corner, garden walk,
Or rocky cistern where we tread the clothes
And gather all the talk?
What is this flesh I purchased with my pains,
This fallen star my milk sustains,
This love that makes my heart's blood stop
Or strikes a Sudden chill into my bones
And bids my hair stand up?

I was eight years old and running with a dime in my hand
Into the bus stop to pick up a paper for my old man
I'd sit on his lap in that big old Buick and steer as we drove through town
He'd tousle my hair and say son take a good look around this is your hometown
This is your hometown
This is your hometown
This is your hometown
In `65 tension was running high at my high school
There was a lot of fights between the black and white
There was nothing you could do
Two cars at a light on a Saturday night in the back seat there was a gun
Words were passed in a shotgun blast
Troubled times had come to my hometown
My hometown
My hometown
My hometown
Now Main Street's whitewashed windows and vacant stores
Seems like there ain't nobody wants to come down here no more
They're closing down the textile mill across the railroad tracks
Foreman says these jobs are going boys and they ain't coming back to your hometown
Your hometown
Your hometown
Your hometown
Last night me and Kate we laid in bed
talking about getting out
Packing up our bags maybe heading south
I'm thirty-five we got a boy of our own now
Last night I sat him up behind the wheel and said son take a good look around
This is your hometown

Wow... After I jumped, it ocurred to me.
Life is perfect.
Life is the best, full of magic, beauty,
opportunity, and television.
And surprises... Lot's of surprises, yeah.
And then there's the best stuff, of course.
Better than anything anyone ever made up, 'cause it's real...
You take a stranger by the hand
A man who doesn't understand
His wildest dreams
You walk across the dirty sand
And offer him an ocean
Of what he's never seen
Maybe I was blind
Or I might have closed my eyes
Maybe I was dumb
But what I forgot to say
If you didn't know is…
Never let me go
Never let me go
Never let me go
You run from love
And don't believe
Unless it catches you by the heel
And even then you struggle
From Red Island across the strand
Your footprints still in the sand
Everything else is washed away
I may not be alone
Or I may have found my home
I may have lost my way
But what I forgot to say
If you didn't know
Is never let me go
Never let me go

Like the tick tick tick of the eye of the clock
You're standing up against the wall
Like the drip drip drip of the rain drops
When the sun shines through
So a voice within me
Keeps revealing you
You
Night and day
You are the one
Only you beneath the moon
And under the sun
Whether near to me or far
It's no matter, baby, where you are
I think of you
Night and day
Day and night
Why is it so ?
That this longing for you follows
Wherever I go
In the roaring traffic gloom
In the silence of my lonely room
I think of you
Night and day
Night and day
Under the hide of me
Though such a hungry yearning
Burning inside of me
This torment won't be through
'Til you let me spend my life
Making love to you
Day and night
Night and day
Night and day
Under the hide of me
Oh, such a hungry yearning
Burning, burning inside of me
This torment won't be through
'Til you let me spend my life
Making love to you
Day and night
Night and day
Night and day
Night and day
Night and day
Night, night, night and day
Night, night, night and day
Night and day
Night,
Night and day
All I want to do
Is make love to you
I'll miss you baby sing it

City street lights
And the multiple life
But babe you gotta give and go
Cigarette lights
Then my finger alights
I need to be alone
She can take you tonight
She can make you, that's alright
She can break you tonight
Don't misunderstand
Cigarette girls
Goes head in and whirls
You will be a superman
Open her booths
Deal must to the bruiser
Drinking all I can
We can take that tonight
We can make them, that's right
We can break them tonight
Don't misunderstand
The light...
Alone in the light
Alone in the light
In the sea of pain
You can take it tonight
She can make you, that's right
She can break you tonight
Don't misunderstand
'cause they cry, and...
Alone in the light
Alone in the light
Alone in the light
In the sea at night
We rode the streets in the morning light
We held our day in our hands
Alone in the light
Alone in the light
Alone in the light
In the sea at night

Don’t talk, just walk
Going nuts, hate my guts
Get good grades, another shove
Stop being a loser
Stop being in love
And why do I need these stupid glasses
I’d give my life to be anyone but me
Yeah
Anyone but me
I wanna be anyone but me
Yeah
This isn’t home, just a house
Broken door, broken glass
Dad’ll yell, tune him out
He’s drunk by now
He has to shout
Keep on walking, just ignore
Just get to your room and shut the door
Let me disappear, or just be
Anywhere but here
Yeah
Anywhere but here
I wanna be
Everyday is like a war and I’m losing it
I’m taking hits from every side
Every side that there is
Everyday I feel the walls are closing in
When can I begin
To get myself right out of this place
Anyone but me
I count the grass as it grows
Anywhere but here
I got to sleep in my clothes
But the shoes don’t fit
I am not what I’ve been told
Where do I, where do I live
I am not what I’ve been sold
What do I take
I’m at the point of possibility
Who will I find
I can almost glimpse infinity
When is the time
I am not where I belong
And I can see an open door
And I can’t live like this, no more
I can’t live like this, no more
I can’t live like this
No more
No no no no no no
No no no more

Forty-five light years
From home
From where you are
Where I wanna be
Beside you
Looking for direction
Star to your affection
The space between you and me
I can't wait any longer
For your love
I can't wait
I can't wait
I can't wait any longer
For it
I can't wait any longer
For your love
The birds still singing for them
As they fly above the firmament
It's not a song of discontent
It's not like that
Up in the sky
Here I am, a space guy
Caught between the love and logic
Out here in the universe
Hey hey
I can't wait any longer
For your love
I can't wait
I can't wait
I can't wait any longer
For it
I can't wait any longer
For your love
And a day as it ends
And you watch as the sun goes down
Pray that the night
Will go quickly now
Your hope
Your prayer
And the clouds leave the sky alone
There's only one light that can guide you
Guide you
I can't wait any longer
I can't wait any longer
For your love
I can't wait any longer
For your love
I can't wait
I can't wait
I can't wait any longer
For your love
For your love
It's like the silence and shock
Of the lights up there shining
You want it
You got it
You want it

Once heard Captain Dan tell me a story
about this lovely girl who's name was Jane
She was vast and deep and filled with glory
Aaaahhhh
Bottom served as home for hull and anchor
She's always fit to quarrel with the wind
The great Titanic yes it's she that sank her
Aaaahhhh
Then she heard me
Say that oath that
made everything clear
I love you
My ocean blue
I like the way your sea sees me
My darling Jane
She speaks to me at times through falling rain
Now twas time to manifest her vigor
Was she fit to quarrel with the wind?
The air was strong but Jane she was much bigger
Aaaaahhhh
Then she heard me
say that oath that
made everything clear

Hasse, hasse, hasse, hasse
White snow turning to slush
A festival of brown in the city of my crush
If you walk around, you can step inside
Köthner straße achtunddreißig
Oh berlin
Who could think they would find you by just looking
Oh berlin
How many of us hide in you
Oh berlin
To think I could know you by your name
To stare and not be stared
To look and not be seen
To feel new feelings
Rather than understand where you've just been
Fame, huh
Oh berlin
Who could they would find you by just looking
Oh berlin
When you flap your angel wings
Oh berlin
To think that I could know you by your name
Chasing the ghosts of our heroes
Lou reed, david bowie, iggy, wim wenders, rilke
To change location rather than change yourself
To ask for directions rather than ask for help
To remain always a true friend
Oh berlin
Who could think they would find you by just looking
Oh berlin
When you flap your angel wings
Oh berlin
To think that I could know you by your name
Who, if I cried out, would hear me among the angelic orders
And even if one to suddenly take me to its heart
I would vanish into its stronger existence
For beauty is nothing but the beginning of terror
That we are still able to bear and we revere it so
Because it calmly disdains to destroy us
Every angel is terror
Every angel is terror
Oh berlin
Every angel is terror
Every angel is terror
Who would think they could find you by just looking
Every angel is terror
Every angel is terror
Oh berlin
How many of us hide in you
Oh berlin
To think that I could know you by a single name

Plus One, Plus two, makes you baby
From old mother hubbard and her big shoe
One too many, one, two not to small
You see the cat in his hat and all
One for the galaxy, One for his voice
You can sing , sing with words in a birdlike song
Math is the sum of magic plus two
Molten lava is hot and chasing us all
Jack be nimble, Jack be quick
Love's so close, your blood is running thick
All you see is written, maybe not correct
Delusion creates illusion and in it we connect
One is for laughter, one is select
You put that king too fast in check
Two is for equal, two is plus tall
Creation measures nobody that falls
You make the difference, you make mistakes
You and the world can all forsake
You are the child born under the stars
Blinding the fear, shines a light of tears
Its all right baby, its all right the milky way
Trust in me shadow, trust in me faith
Ten commandments we all have to face
This is no division, no great divide
Suicide is no place to hide
Crimson is the color of the great red tide
Plus one, Plus two is who made you
You make the changes, two makes me shake
Spiritual Father and mother complete
Trinity is in the child born that we seek.
You one, you two, here is the clue
Lord Jesus is the breakthrough
When Johnny comes marching home again

See a red door
And I want it painted black
No colors anymore
I want them to turn black
I see the girls walk by
Dressed in their summer clothes
I have to turn my head
Until my darkness goes
I see a line of cars
And they're all painted black
With flowers and my love
Both never to come back
I see them turn their heads
Quickly look away
Like a newborn baby
It just happens every day
I look inside my self
See my heart is back
I see my red door
And I want it painted black
Maybe then I'll fade away
And not have to face the facts
It's not easy facing up
When your whole world is black
No more will my green sea
Go turn a deeper blue
I could not foresee
This thing happening to you.
If I look hard enough
Into the setting sun
My love will laugh with me
Before the morning comes
I wanna see it painted
Painted black
Black as night
I wanna see it painted
Painted black
Black as night
I wanna see it painted
Painted black
Black as night
I wanna see it painted
Painted black
Black as night
I wanna see it painted
Painted black

I wanna see it painted

Search on, man
God speed and forgive you
Moonshine night
Mountain village
Insane in the woods
In the deep trees
Under the moon
Beneath the stars
They reel and dance
The young folk
Led to the lake
By a king and queen
Oh, I want to be there
I want us to be there
Beside the lake
Beneath the moon
Cool and swollen
Dripping its hot liquor
Frozen moment by a lake
A knife has been stolen
The death of the snake
I know the impossible sea
When the dogs bark
I am a death bird
Naughty night bird
There’s a belief by the children
Of man which states all will be well
Search on, man
Calm saviour
Veteran of wars, incalculable greed
Search on, man
Calm saviour
God speed and forgive you
Morning star
Fragrant meadow person girl
Waiting for us
Waiting for us
Waiting for us
They’re coming
Don’t you
In the broken dagger
My kind of yearn
Who is this
Hush now
Here, out in the desert somewhere in new mexico, the feds have their own covert, non-existent missile-testing facilities. You know, but it goes on for several hundreds of miles with those scary signs that read: “do not trespass or we shoot.” deploying what they call weather balloons, when in actuality it is hydrogen testing.
Before we end our day, oh lord
We make this prayer to you
Before we end our day, oh lord
We make this prayer to you
These tests happen so far underground the fallout feeds into our water supply.
That you continue in your love
To guard your people here
That you continue in your love
To guard your people here
Be patient. It will be ready for consumption in less than 30 years.
Give us this night untroubled rest
And build our strength in you
Give us this night untroubled rest
And build our strength in you
Your splendour driving far away
All darkness of the fog
Your splendour driving far away
All darkness of the fog
Our hearts desire to love you, lord
Watch over while we sleep
Our hearts desire to love you, lord
Watch over while we sleep
That when the new day dawns on high
We may your praises sing
That when the new day dawns on high
We may your praises sing
Amen, amen, amen, amen

There's a train a-coming
You don't need no baggage
You just get on board
All you need is faith
To hear the diesels humming
Don't need no ticket
You just thank the lord
People get ready
For the train to jordan
Picking up passengers
From coast to coast
Faith is the key
Open the doors and board them
There's room for all
Among the loved the most
There aint no room
For the hopeless sinner
Who would hurt all mankind just
To save his own
Have pity on those
Whose chances are thinner
Cause there's no hiding place
From the kingdoms throne
So people get ready
For the train a-coming
You don't need no baggage

Inclined to climb up beside you,
Would you tell me that the time just isnt right?
And if I ever find the key you hide so well,
Will you tell me that I can spend the night?
Leavin your smell on my coat, leavin your taste on my shoulder.
I still fail to understand what it is about this woman.
If I could bottle up the chills that you give me
I would keep them in a jar next to my bed.
And If I should ever draw a picture of a woman
It is you that would come flowing from my pen
Leavin your clothes on the floor, Making me walk out the door
And I still fail to understand what it is about this woman.
Helplessly melting as I stand next to the sun.
As she burns me, I am screaming out for more
Drink every drop of liquid heat that I've become.
Pop me open, spoon me out on to the floor.
Leavin your smell on my coat, leavin your taste on my shoulder,
I still fail to understand

So you never knew love
Until you crossed the line of grace.
And you never felt wanted
Till you'd someone slap your face.
So you never felt alive
Until you'd almost wasted away.
You had to win, you couldn't just pass
The smartest ass at the top of the class
Your flying colours, your family tree
And all your lessons in history.
Please, please, please
Get up off your knees.
Please, please, please, please, oh yeah.
And you never knew how low you'd stoop
To make that call
And you never knew what was on the ground
Till they made you crawl.
So you never knew that the heaven
You keep you stole.
Your Catholic blues, your convent shoes,
Your stick-on tattoos now they're making the news
Your holy war, your northern star
Your sermon on the mount from the boot of your car.
Please, please, please
Get up off your knees.
Please, please, please
Leave me out of this, please.
So love is hard
And love is tough
But love is not
What you're thinking of.
September, streets capsizing
Spilling over down the drains
Shard of glass, splinters like rain
But you could only feel your own pain.
October, talk getting nowhere.
November, December; remember
We just started again.
Please, please, please
Get up off your knees, yeah.
Please, please, please, please, ah.
So love is big
Is bigger than us.
But love is not
What you're thinking of.
It's what lovers deal
It's what lovers steal
You know I've found it
Hard to receive
'Cause you, my love
I could never believe.

Spider-man, spider-man
Enhanced genetics
Spider-man
Super-human kinetics
Spider-man
Muscle augmentation
And look at that, web bio-generation
This, this looks like my work
It's getting out
Your life's work, your precious research
Your secrets
Getting sold, getting bought
It isn't possible, is it
It's not, or is it
Maybe it was kassidy
You relied on loyalty
All your staff, where did they go
And what did they take
And what did they know
Our funding dried up
They weren't getting paid
How's it feel to be betrayed
They're leaving like rats from a sinking ship
You're losing control, you're letting it slip
Time to get it
You've been stabbed in the back
Are you gonna roll over, play dead
Or attack
Competition, I don't have any
Wake up son
Someone's cheating you
You do have competition and they're beating you
So fight back, what
Are you just gonna wait
It's an arms race, boy
You can't hesitate
We want new men
A new breed of marines
Not human, we want fighting machines
A new species, one that's harder to kill
And what if I won't
We'll get someone who will
Don't just think of you
Think of God and country
Join the proud and few who know best for their country
Get some patriotic pride or get on to the other side
How do we win, by living in fear
How do we win, get the enemy clear
How do we win, by saying it's done in retaliation
How do we win, by clearing them out
How do we win, by murdering doubt
How do we win, 'cause we're in the right
Get in line or say goodnight
Don't just think of you
Think of God and country
Join the proud and few who know best for their country
Get some patriotic pride or get on to the other side
So deliver
I ain't working for you
We want bigger
That ain't something I do
Pull the trigger
Start being a man
Take care of real business or get off the can
Start making and you'll be in control
Start taking, you wanna suck out my soul
Get funded or your baby won't live
I'm gonna say no
You mean affirmative
Yes sir hut hut
Yes sir hut hut
Yes sir hut hut
Yes sir hut hut

Hut hut hut hut
Hut hut hut two three

Through the fields of flame I ran with you
Every blow you took I took with you
I lied for you when you moved underground
And covered you as the storm of rage came down
But I will not wear you like a purple heart
I will not wear you like a purple heart
To the raging moon burning in the sun
I held on to you, you held on to no one
I followed you 'til you were out of sight
And felt the pain as the bullets took the night
But I will not wear you like a purple heart
I will not wear you like a purple heart

Oh I talk to you, you walk away.
You're still on the down beat
You say you don't want my help.
But you can't escape if you're running from yourself.
I give you my love
I give you my love
Give you my love
Still you walk away.
Well
It's your own late show as you jump to the street below.
But where can you go to leave yourself behind?
Alone in the spotlight of this, your own tragedy.
I give you my love.
Love.

Rise Up
In a stairway on a on a stone walk
In a doorstep, golden light
In a cold wind blowing
In the danger, out of the storm
I remain in you
I will recall this storm
This storm recalls you
Rise up, rise up, rise up, rise up
Rise up, rise up, rise up, rise up
Rise up, rise up, rise up, rise up
Rise up, rise up, rise up, rise up
In the lands you have a garden
In the garden it's going dark
In the cold a wind blowing
In the cold wind blowing
I am in this doorway
Feel her in this doorway
Golden hills, golden memories
I follow the ocean wherever it goes
In the doorway I don't know where to start
Emotion in the cold
In the day, darkest night
In the darkest night I know
I stumble in these shoes
In the dark night
Rise up, rise up, rise up, rise up
Rise up, rise up, rise up, rise up
Rise up, rise up, rise up, rise up
Rise up, rise up, rise up, rise up
Rise up, rise up, rise up, rise up
Rise up, rise up, rise up, rise up
Rise up, rise up, rise up, rise up
Rise up, rise up, rise up, rise up
Go in the lonely, lone
Loneliness a path to go
Only if you know
Our love helps me know
Your love will help me
Discover you beneath the thing
Only if you know
Only rise up, rise up

Well it's so hard to listen to these trains
Outside my window here it comes again
And it's calling me begging me
Follow me down the track
And it moans so dark and low
Baby ain't comin' back
Well I refuse to believe
It could happen to me and you
But it's lonesome and it's hard and it's true
I got this whiskey to take care of my lips
I got these long cool steel strings
At my fingertips
I ain't got nothing, I ain't got nothing
To soothe my aching soul
Except this screeching and screaming iron
To tell me where I ought to go
Well I refuse to believe
It could happen to me and you
But it's lonesome and it's hard... and it's true
And I hear the train sigh
And idle down below
Why your love is so sweet and wild
Is something I'll never know
And it sounds like crying
And it sounds like letting go
Oh, breathing and lying
Sinking and dying slow
And I watch from my window
Touching the cold glass sky
And as the train rolls down the track
I say...
Goodbye
Home, home
You wanna take me home?
Home, home
'Cause I wanna go, I wanna
Wanna, wanna, wanna go home
Home, home, ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-home
I wanna go, I wanna love
Take, take, take, take, take me home
Home, no no no no no no no love
Hey, hey
Please...

Home, home
No no no no no no no love
No no no, no no no, no no no love

She would never say where she came from
Yesterday don't matter if it's gone
While the sun is bright
Or in the darkest night
No one knows
She comes and goes
Goodbye, Ruby Tuesday
Who could hang a name on you?
When you change with every new day
Still I'm gonna miss you...
Don't question why she needs to be so free
She'll tell you it's the only way to be
She just can't be chained
To a life where nothing's gained
And nothing's lost
At such a cost
Goodbye, Ruby Tuesday
Who could hang a name on you?
When you change with every new day
Still I'm gonna miss you...
There's no time to lose, I heard her say
Catch your dreams before they slip away
Dying all the time
Lose your dreams
And you will lose your mind.
Ain't life unkind?
Goodbye, Ruby Tuesday
Who could hang a name on you?
When you change with every new day
Still I'm gonna miss you...

Stood on his shadow
They always do
All he wanted to spoil the view
Of people and places
Second-hand faces
He saw but never knew
Look like a painting
A picture of you
Depending on your point of view
She laughed with the others
They call out her name
She smiled, she said
Goodbye
On a Saturday night
On a Saturday night
On a Saturday night
On a Saturday night
Saturday night
Saturday night
They met at a streetlight
Though she never knew
All he wanted was to spoil the view
And just for a second
It felt like a year
He waited for her second tear
On a Saturday night
On a Saturday night
On a Saturday night
On a Saturday night
Saturday night
Saturday night
Can you soar any higher
If you can't let go
To save her in the fire
She won't say no

Say goodbye.
It takes a seconds to say goodbye,
Say goodbay,say bye bye
Where are you going to now?
Lightning flashes across the sky,
From east to wast you do or die.
Like a thief in the night,
You see the world by candlelight.
Fall,rise and...Fall rise and...
In an apartment on Times Square,
You can assemble them anywhere.
Held ro ransom,hell to play,
A revolution every day.

Say goodbye,Say goodbye,
Say goodbye,Say goodbye.

Push the button and pull the plug,say goodbye.
Fall,rise and...Fall,rise and...

Do they know where the dance comes from?
Yes they're doing the atomic bomb,
They wnat you to sing along.

Darkness falls and she
Will take me by the hand
Take me to some twilight land
Where all but love is gray
Where I can find my way
Without her as my guide
Night falls, I'm cast beneath her spell
Daylight falls, our heaven turns to hell
Am I left to burn
And burn eternally
She's a mystery to me
She's a mystery girl
She's a mystery girl
She's a mystery girl
She's a mystery girl
In the night of love
Words tangled in her hair
Words soon to disappear
A love so sharp it cut
Like a switchblade to my heart
Words tearing me apart
She tears again my bleeding heart
I want to run, she's pulling me apart
Fallen angel cries
Then I just melt away
She's a mystery girl
She's a mystery girl
She's a mystery girl
She's a mystery girl
She's a mystery girl
Haunted by her side
It's a darkness in her eyes
That so enslaves me
And if my love is blind
Then I don't want to see
She's a mystery to me
Night falls, I'm cast beneath her spell
Daylight comes, our heaven turns to hell
Am I left to burn
And burn eternally
She's a mystery to me
She's a mystery girl
She's a mystery girl
She's a mystery girl
She's a mystery girl

Mystery girl

Now come thoughts that you shall not banish
Secret fears, visions never to vanish
Crawling shapes now come writhing out
To cast their shadows over this human rout
You set yourself on fire
You set yourself on fire
You set yourself on fire
Breath of our breath with no blood or bone
Never grows weary, never grows old
Mutters and mumbles in infinite ways
Ever the tyrant to the willing slaves
You set yourself on fire
You set yourself on fire
You set yourself on fire
Much of madness and more of sin
No government of this vast, formless thing
You set yourself on fire
You set yourself on fire

Wake
In the morning when you wake up
You won’t have much but you’ll have enough
When you are weakest I’ll be strong enough for you
Dreams, the ones where you are fearless
Can’t break what’s broken, you are tearless
Steal back your innocence
That’s what they stole from you
You’re gonna sleep like a baby tonight
Not everything can be so black and white
There are demons in the broad daylight
But you can sleep like a baby tonight
Stop, stop
Where you stand right now, just stop
Don’t think or look down at the drop
The people staring from the street don’t know what you’ve got
You’re gonna sleep like a baby tonight
No, not everything can be so black and white
There are demons in the broad daylight
But you can sleep like a baby tonight
Hope is where the door is
When home is where the war is
Where nobody can feel no one else’s pain
You’re gonna sleep like a baby tonight
Not everything can be so black and white
There are demons in the broad daylight
You’ve got to sleep like a baby tonight
Sleep like a baby tonight
Take care of your heart until it is light
Where you stand, where you fall is where I kneel
To take your heart back to where you can feel
Like a child, a child

Are you gonna take it down?
Oh babe, I don't wanna deal it
Oh, make it alright
Gime some, my love
Away, away, away
I just wanna slide away and come alive again
I just wanna slide away and come alive again
I will see that love again, and find a life again
I just wanna slide away and come alive again
I wanted to let it go

And I would find you wings to fly
And I would catch you
I would catch your fall
I just wanna slide away and come alive again
I just wanna slide away and come alive again
I will see that love again, and find a life again
I just wanna slide away and come alive again

All this weeping in the air,
I can tell were about to fall through floating forests in theair
Across the rolling open sea.
Now I kiss and run through air. Leave the past find nowhere,
Floating forests in the air clowns all around you.
Clowns are here to let u know where u let your senses go.
Clowns all around you its a cross i need to bear.
All this black and cruel is fair, this is an emergency
Don't you hide your eyes from me, open them and see me now.
Can u see me now? Can u see? Can u see me now?
Can u see? Can u see? Can u see?
Can u see? Can u see me now? Can u see?
Can u see? Can u see me now?
Can u see me now? Can u see clowns all around you.
Can u see? Can u see?
Can u see? Can u see me now?
Floating, floating, floating, floating.
See me here in the air not holding on to anywhere
But holding on so beware I have secrets I wont share.
See me here wishing you if I don't deny I do contemplate our wishaway.
If I ask u not to stay, clowns are here to let u know where u letyour senses go,
Clowns all around you it's a cross I need to bare.
All this black and cruel is fair,
This is an emergency don't you hide your eyes from me
Open them and see me now.
Can u see me now? Can u see me now? Can u see? Can u see? Can usee?

My love is cruel as the night
She steals the sun and shuts out the light.
All of my colours, they turn to blue
Win or lose.
She does his slow dancing, slow dancing,
She does his slow... dancing.
All night long.
Scarlet eyes and see-through heart
She saw me coming right from the start.
She picked me up, but had me down on my knees
Just to begging her, begging her please.
Take me slow dancing, slow dancing,
She took me slow... dancing.
All night long.
And, I don't know why a man
Search for himself in his lover's eyes.
No, I don't know why a man
Sees the truth, but needs the lies.
My love is restless as the wind
She moves like a shadow across my skin
She left with my conscience
I don't want it back.
It just gets in the way.
If you wanna go slow dancing, slow dancing,
She took me slow... dancing.
All night long.
Slow dancing

Don't want you to get hurt
Can't help it, I'm a flirt
Don't want to take your drugs

Don't want to overdress
Don't want to make a mess
Don't want you to confess
Not under duress
Don't want to be untrue

Don't want to change the frame

Gravity, it's not pulling me
I won't be a picture with no sound
Decaying, I'm praying
You are my air
But I need the ground to kneel upon
And love can't be us all
I don't want to see you smile
I'm breaking it, taking it
I'm breaking slowly in my mind
I'm seeing it, free in it
I know love is in this soul of mine
It's not in your eyes
I don't want
I don't want to see you smile
It started light-hearted
I won't be easier like you said
I'm going, flowing
I'm leaving on the day
Of the day I will live again
You will live again
I don't want to see you smile
God knows, He knows me
Knows me, lonely
You see, hear me, love
Say it again
You're not blind
The smoke machine
Is yours, not mine
I don't want to see you smile
I will live again
You will live again
I just don't want to see you smile

Like to, I'd like to try a song that I
Think we've only played once before, so
This is a city that a lot of irish people came to this city,right?
So this time, this irish, these irish people
Came as rock and roll band, okay?
So, but this is a folk song
It's like, the irish kinda' hold america
In a very special place because, for over a hundred years or more
Irish have come over here to find work and find a future
And they brouught with them songs, old irish folk songs
That became old american folk songs
And, I hope maybe we'd leave behind some songs one day.
This is a song written by peggy seeger
It's a song
I wished I'd heard this song on the raidio
During the miners' strike in england a few years ago
This is called springhill mining disaster
In the town of springhill nova scotia
Down in the dark of the cumberland mine
There's blood on the coal, and the miners lie
In roads that never saw sun or sky
Roads
Shut up for a second, will you?
Stop whistling 'cause I'm not in the beatles, okay?
It's U2 here
In the town of springhill
They don't sleep easy
Often the earth will tremble and roll
When the earth is restless
Miners die
Bone and blood is the price of coal
Bone and blood is the price of coal
Listen to the shouts of the black faced miner
Listen to the call of the rescue team
We have no water, light or bread
So we're living on songs and hope instead
Living on songs and hope instead
In the town of springhill nova scotia
Down in the dark of the cumberland mine
There's blood on the coal, and the miners lie
In roads that never saw sun or sky
Roads that never saw sun nor sky
In the town of springhill
Don't sleep easy
Often the earth will tremble and roll
When the earth is restless
Miners die
Bone and blood is the price of coal
Bone and blood is the price of coal
Bone and blood is the price of coal

Or the mountains should crumble to the sea

Just you and you're not mine
Stateless
Weightless
There are no colours in your eyes
There's no sunshine in your skies
There's no race only the prize
There is no tomorrow only tonight
Stateless, what's the difference?
You can cover the world with your thumb
But it's still so big, so bright, so beautiful
Stateless
Weightless

Pushing down on me
Feel your weight
Want to feel your weight

Green light, 7-11
You stop in for a pack of cigarettes
You don't smoke, don't even want to
Hey now, check your change
Dressed up like a car crash
Your wheels are turning but you're upside down
You say when he hits you, you don't mind
Because when he hurts you, you feel alive
Hey babe, is that what it is
Red lights, gray morning
You stumble out of a hole in the ground
A vampire or a victim
It depends on who is around
You used to stay in to watch the adverts
You could lip synch to the talk shows
And if you look, you look through me
And when you talk, you talk at me
And when I touch you, you don't feel a thing
If I could stay
Then the night would give you up
Stay...and the day would keep its trust
Stay...and the night would be enough
Faraway, so close
Up with the static and the radio
With satellite television
You can go anywhere
Miami, new orleans
London, belfast and berlin
And if you listen I can't call
And if you jump, you just might fall
And if you shout, I'll only hear you
If I could stay
Then the night would give you up
Stay... Then the day would keep its trust
Stay... With the demons you drowned
Stay... With the spirit I found
Stay... And the night would be enough
Three o'clock in the morning
It's quiet and there's no one around
Just the bang and the clatter
As an angel runs to ground
Just the bang
And the clatter
As an angel
Hits the ground

When the sky falls and the Earth quakes
We gon put this back together
We won't break
Sa Pa Sé, my Port-Au-Princes
my Haitian Gods and all of my Princesses
Our condolences as you fightin' against this
we're right by your side as we tryin' to make sense of this
heavenly father help us see through these problems
and for those that left, accept them into your garden
so here's my theory, the country's already starvin'
so we sacrificed many to shed light on all of them
God please pardon, I speak from the heart
its the only way I see this tragedy befall on them
so lets get involved with them, hand to hand with them
arm to arm with them til they get strong again,
When the sky falls…
Can't wait until tomorrow
Haiti, Mon Amour
Haiti, Mon Amour
Not gonna leave you stranded, alone, alone
oh no
Learn from the past, New Orleans was flooded
So we know we just can't rely on the government
We under the rubble again, here we go rumbling when
When we gon catch a break, my friend lost his mother and then
And then, Carline lost her uncles and them
Buried with no caskets, they just put covers on them
And the tears fall, and we fight back
Story ain't done, it can't end like that
Nah not like this, tomorrow's survivors gonna carry on your name
You live on inside us, your memory's alive with us
You inspired us, to rebuild this country, you just guide us
It's not the angels that are on their way
its not the bells of Santa Trinite
the people waiting, position vacant(?)
for hands to help, not just to pray
Haïti va s'élever
Tu vas te relever
Nous nous éléverons
Ensemble ensemble ensemble
(not gonna leave you stranded…)
we gon put this back together we wont break
we gon put this back together we wont break
we gon put this back together we wont break
we gon put this back together we wont break

Stranger, stranger in a strange land.
He looked at me like I was the one who should run.
We asked him to smile for a photograph
Waited a while to see if we could make him laugh.
The soldier asked for a cigarette
His smiling face I can't forget.
He looked at me across the street
But that's a long way here.
Oh, and I wish you were here.
Oh, and I wish you were here.
Stranger, stranger in a strange land.
He looked at me like I was the one who should run.
I watched as he watched us get back on the bus
I watched the way it was
The way it was when he was with us
And I really don't mind sleeping on the floor
But I couldn't sleep after what I saw
I wrote this letter to tell you the way I feel.
Oh I wish you were here
Oh I wish you were here
To see what I could see
To hear
And I wish you were here.

Every man has two cities he needs to be
The one he can touch
And the one he can’t see
The one where a stranger’s a friend
Every man has got one city of liberty
For me it’s Paris, I love it
Every time I get lost down these ancient streets I find myself again
You’re free, baby, baby
Free now and forever
It’s Christmas time
You can decide to forget or to remember
You’re free, baby, baby
I didn’t come down here to fight ya
I came down these streets of love and pride to surrender
The streets of surrender
I heard a farfetched story
That nobody seems to know
I think it was about that stranger
It was youth, it was love and it was danger
It was winter with that warm it gets before the snow
It chilled my soul
Everybody’s crying about some kid
That they found lying on a beach
Born in a manger
You’re free, baby, baby
Free now and forever
It’s Christmas time
You can decide to forget or to remember
You’re free, baby, baby
I didn’t come down here to fight ya
I came down these streets of love and pride to surrender
The streets of surrender

Strawberries, cherries
And an angel´s kiss in spring
My summer wine is really made
From all these things
I walked in town
On silver spurs that jingled too
And sang a song
That I had sang just for a few
She saw my silver spurs
And said lets pass some time
And I will give to you summer wine
Oh summer wine
Strawberries, cherries
And an angel´s kiss in spring
My summer wine is really made
From all these things
Take off your silver spurs
And help me pass the time
And I will give to you summer wine
Oh summer wine
My eyes grew heavy and my lips
They could not speak
I tried to stand up
But I could not find my feet
She reassured me with an unfamiliar line
And then she gave to me more summer wine
Oh summer wine
Strawberries, cherries
And an angel´s kiss in spring
My summer wine is really made
From all these things
Take off your silver spurs
And help me pass the time
And I will give to you summer wine
Oh summer wine
When we woke up the sun was shining in our eyes
My silver spurs were gone
My head felt twice the size
We took my silver spurs a dollar and a dime
And left us craving for more summer wine
Oh summer wine

The city's alight
With lover and lies
Bright blue eyes.
The city's bright,
Brighter than day tonight,
Surrender, Surrender,
Surrender, Surrender.
Sadie said she couldn't
Work out what it was all about.
And so she let go,
Now Sadie's on the street,
And the people she mees you know.
She tried be to be a good girl
And a good wife.
Raise a good family.
Lead a good life.
It's not good enough
She got herself up on the 48th floor
Got to find out,find out
What she's living for.
Surrender, Surrender,
Surrender, Surrender.
The city's a fire,
A passionate flame
That knows me by name.
The city's desire
To take me for more and more.
It's in the street getting under my feet,
It's in the air it's everywere I look for you,
It's in the things I do and say.
If I want to live, I've got to die to myself
someday.
Papa sing my sing my song,
Papa sing my sing my song,

Days on the run
Nights in hiding
Hoping that you were
The healing inside me
Breathe in the sweet fire of love / i'm not afraid anymore
Sweet, sweet fire / i'm not alone
Breathe in the sweet fire of love / i'm not the same anymore
Sweet, sweet fire / the sweet fire of love
The sweet fire of love
Didn't we cross new waters
Didn't we mix new blood
Didn't we build brand new bridges
Didn't we hold back the flood
Broken idols by the side of the road
They didn't fall on the side of the law
Here she comes a-shining like a light
Here she comes salvation in the night
Days on the run
Nights in hiding
Hoping that you were
The healing inside me
Breathe in the sweet fire of love / i'm not afraid anymore
Sweet, sweet fire / i'm not alone
Breathe in the sweet fire of love / i'm not the same anymore
Sweet, sweet fire / sweet fire of love
Fire of love
(sweet fire of love)
Didn't we shine like silver
Didn't we bear the cross
Didn't we bring down the hammer
Didn't we beat on the drum
Didn't we?
Days on the run / here she comes a-shining like a light
Nights in hiding / here she comes salvation in the night
Hoping that you were / i'm giving up the ghost
The healing inside me / i'm giving up the ghost
Breathe in the sweet fire of love / i'm not afraid anymore
Sweet, sweet fire / i'm not alone
Breathe in the sweetest fire of love / i'm not the same anymore
Sweet, sweet fire / sweet fire of love
Sweet fire of love
Fire of love
Love, love
Sweet fire of love
Fire, yes
(hey, hey soul)
(hey, hey, love)
(hey, hey)
(hey, hey love)

My love, she throws me like a rubber ball
(Oh, the sweetest thing.)
But she won't catch me or break my fall.
(Oh, the sweetest thing.)
Baby's got blue skies up ahead
But in this, I'm a raincloud
You know she wants a dry kind of love.
(Oh, the sweetest thing.)
I'm losin' you, I'm losin' you
Ain't love the sweetest thing?
I wanted to run, but she made me crawl
(Oh, the sweetest thing.)
Eternal fire, she turned me to straw.
(Oh, the sweetest thing.)
I know I got black eyes
But they burn so brightly for her
I guess it's a blind kind of love.
(Oh, the sweetest thing.)
I'm losin' you, I'm losin' you
Ain't love the sweetest thing?
Ain't love the sweetest thing?
Blue-eyed boy meets a brown-eyed girl.
(Oh, the sweetest thing.)
You can sew it up, but you still see the tear.
(Oh, the sweetest thing.)
Baby's got blue skies up ahead
But in this, I'm a rain-cloud,
Ours is a stormy kind of love.
(Oh, the sweetest thing.)

(Ooo, Ooo, yeah)
(Come on)
Look over yonder, Apollo at a distance
You can hear his music if you listen to the wind (blow)
I want to be there - I want to be right there
I want to see it with my own eyes
Bear witness, I'm wailing like the wind
Come bear witness, the half-breed rides again
In these hands, I've held the broken dream
In my soul, I'm howling at the moon
Testimony / Whoa-ah
Testimony / Whoa-ah
Declare yourself, I will testify
Testimony / Whoa-ah
Testimony / Whoa-ah
State the truth, I will testify
I had a revelation like runaway horses
Took to the road with a carnival show (roll on)
Those golden days on Smokey Mountain (lord)
Playing guitar in a one man band (that's right)
Bear witness, I'm howling at the moon
Come bear witness, I've danced among the ruins
In these shoes, I've walked a crooked mile
All my life I been searching for the nightbird
Testimony, testimony
Declare yourself - I will testify
Testimony / Ah-ha
Testimony / Whoa-ah
Speak the truth, I will testify
Are you ready to take the heat
Are you ready to blow the steam
Are you ready to bag the street
You got nothing to lose - but your chains
For forty days and forty nights
I come across the desert
Apollo right by my side (rave on)
Bear witness, I'm wailing like the wind
Come bear witness, the half-breed rides again
In these hands, I've held the broken dream
In my soul, I'm howling at the moon
Testimony, testimony (tell them)
Declare yourself - I will testify
Testimony (oh oh), testimony
Speak the truth, I will testify
(This is my)
(Testimony, testimony) / Mmm this is my testimony
(I will testify)
Testimony ah ha
Testimony whoa ha
Speak the truth
I will testify
Testimony, testimony oh-ha

That's life, that's what all the people say
You're ridin' high in April, you're shot down in May
But I know I'm gonna change that tune
When I'm back on top, back on top in June
I say that's life, and as funny as it may seem
Some people get their kicks stompin' on a dream
But I don't let it, get me down
'Cause this old world, just keeps spinnin' around
I've been a puppet, a poet, a pauper, a pirate, a pawn and a king
I've been up and down and over and out and I know one thing
Each time I find myself flat on my face
I pick myself up and get back in the race
That's life, I tell ya, I can't deny it
I thought of quitting baby, but my heart just won't buy it
And if I didn't think it was worth just one more try
I'd roll myself up in a big ball and die
I've been a puppet, a pauper, a pirate, a poet, a pawn and a king
I've been up and down, over and out, I know one thing
Each time I find myself layin' flat on my face
I just pick myself up and I get back in the race
That's life, I can't deny it
I thought of quitting baby, but my heart just won't buy it
But if there's nothin' shakin' come here this July
I'm gonna roll myself up in a big ball and die

Here's to the Ronnie, the voice we adore
Like coals from a coal bucket scraping the floor
Sing out his praises in music and malt
And if you're not Irish, that isn't your fault
Raise up our voices like dogs in a pack
Thankful for honest men we never lack
We got 'in by twenties, we got 'in by ones
Them and their daughters and all of their sons
Here's to you, Ronnie Drew
Here's to you, Ronnie Drew
Ronnie Drew, we love you, yes we do
Here's to you, Ronnie Drew, here's to you
And what's it to any man whether or no'
Whether I'm easy or whether I'm true
As I lifted her petticoat easy and slow
And I tied up me sleeve for to buckle her shoe
Get up and go at it, five until five
When the whistle says budge it we come back alive
He'll sing to the heavens, he's stormy as hell
And wherever he goes, we'll be wishing him well
Here's to you, Ronnie Drew
Here's to you, Ronnie Drew
Ronnie Drew, we love you, yes we do
Here's to you, Ronnie Drew, here's to you
The dawn and the dust, the wise, the unjust
Kids in gambling games
The unheard, the unseen, the unwashed and unclean
Where the streets all have names
Baggers, street masons, street wagons to Stevens
With lovers and loners who can hear all intoners
The goths and the ravers, invalids and traders
Sing out Ronnie Drew
A life for a life or a hand for a hand
Trust in the music and strike up the band
The more that we sing the less that we fight
Time and again this is proved to be right
Build you a statue on St. Stephen's Green
No fairer monument ere to be seen
The statue of Ronnie Drew holding the hand
Of a girl with her hair in a black velvet band
Here's to you, Ronnie Drew
No stranger to devils or angles to tell
Here's to you, Ronnie Drew
A friend of a friend of a friend of a friend of a friend to you
Ronnie Drew, we love you, yes we do
Here's to you, Ronnie Drew, here's to you
Here's to you, Ronnie Drew, here's to you, Ronnie Drew
Here's to you, Ronnie Drew, here's to you, Ronnie Drew
And what's it to any man whether or no'
Whether I'm easy or whether I'm true
As I lifted her petticoat easy and slow
And I rolled up me sleeve for to buckle her shoe

When you look so good
The pain in your face doesn't show
When you look so good
Baby, you don't even know
When the world is ours
And every door smells of fresh paint
When the girl involved
Says its friction that makes you a saint
When we've seen enough
To know it's children that teach
When you're free enough
To wake up on a bed on a beach
You're the best thing about me
The best thing that ever happened to boy
You're the best thing about me
I'm the kinda trouble that you enjoy
You're the best thing about me
The best thing are easy to destroy
You're the best thing about me
Why... why am I walking away
Why am I walking away
I'll be crying out
How bad can a good boy be?
Shooting off my mouth
That's another great thing about me
I got everything, but I feel like nothing at all
There's no risky thing for a man
Who's determined to fall
You're the best thing about me
The best thing that ever happened a boy
You're the best thing about me
I'm the kinda trouble that you enjoy
You're the best thing about me
The best things are easy to destroy
Save me from myself
The best thing
The best thing

Take me to the house of rain
You know I'm gonna never be
Matches in a simple way
As the structure sits along the way
Hey that`s known as the flowering rose, a flowering rose that said my name
Kings and wine the flowering rose, the flowering rose of Glastonbury
Yeah, oh, rock and roll sunshine
Yeah, oh, a miracle will give you time
Some things you just can`t control
Sometimes you have to let go
Going to a brand new set
Music it will set me right
Nothing for the house of rain
Nothing that has ever been
Hey that`s known as the flowering rose, a flowering rose that said my name
Kings and wine the flowering rose, the flowering rose of Glastonbury
Yeah, oh rock n roll sunshine
Yeah oh a miracle will give you time
Living like a pilgrim sleeping
Under the flower of the American dream
Set the scene like a thought worth keepin
Livin in a dream jeez you can't be sleepin
Yeah, oh, rock n roll sunshine
Yeah, oh, A miracle will give you time
Yeah, oh rock n roll sunshine

Alive in an ocean
A world that I didn't see
I walk the world backways
It's aways the same ballgame
That's out of mind
Out of the living world
Out of time
I break all the rules
They call me a fool
I cartoon in motion
A hero pretends no pain
A clown slipping backwards
You laugh at another's shame
But I don't mind
I know I'm limping low down
I don't mind
Winners or losers
It's all just a game
And I'm going down
And I'm strolling down
Life and an answer
The key to an open door
Admiting I'm laughing
Living I'm limping more
It's out of mind
Out of the living world
Out of time
Winners or losers
It's always a game
And I'm going down
But I'm strolling down
To rout around
And around, and around
To round round
There's a cloud
There's a cloud
So...the fool has found the golden key
So...it's waiting there for you and me
Just a fool, a street jester
The hero of society
Just a fool, a street jester
Look at me, now can't you see
A life in emotion
A world I'm glad I didn't see
A cartoon in motion
A key to the same day
I don't mind, I'm here to know
I wanna go go go go go
So...the fool has found the golden key
It's so...it's waiting there for you and me
Just a fool, a street jester
The hero of society
Just a fool, a street jester
Look at me, now can't you see

Shake the plastic bag and do the twisty-thingy-doo

And he does it with a smile and never judges you.
Who can take this diaper
Ma'am, I don't mind at all
Who can clean me up before the big policeman's ball
The garbage man
Yes, the garbage man can
The sanitation folks are jolly friendly folks
Courteous and easy-going

And tell you when you arse is showing

Shine like a fading sky
She holds one love, the sky
It's no secret that the stars
Are falling from the sky
It's no secret that I left you
And still I don't know why
You say the sun is sometimes
Eclipsed by a moon
You know I'd come back, baby
If you gave me some room
It's no secret that a friend
Is someone who lets you help
It's no secret that a liar
Won't believe anyone else
They say a secret is something
You tell one other person
What do you think
Child...
Love...shine like a fading sky
She holds one love, the sky
A man will beg
A man will crawl
But it's never too late
To take his call
It's no secret at all
It's no secret that a conscience can sometimes be a pest
It's no secret ambition bites the nails of success
Every artist is a cannibal, every poet is a thief
And everyone needs music 'cause everyone needs relief
Love...live like a shining star
She calls, the sun will burn
A man will rise
A man will fall
From the sheer face of love
Like a fly from a wall
It's no secret at all
Love...you shine like a burning star
You're falling from the sky
Tonight...
Love...you shine like a burning star
You're falling from the sky
A man will rise
A man will fall
Tonight...
From the sheer face of love
Like a fly from a wall
It's no secret at all
It's no secret that the stars are falling from the sky
The universe expolded 'cause one man told a lie
Look, I gotta go, yeah I'm running outta change
There's a lot of things, if I could I'd rearrange
Love...shine like a fading sky
She holds one love, the sky

Life on a distant planet
So cool inside of here
You can see her but she can't see you
You can call her name but she won't even hear you

D-Day and beyond
Lost on a silent planet
To look rising stars
Lost on a silent planet
So close and yet so far
Children scream and shout their eyes call out
Judith turns around and stumbles to the ground

Have you nothing to say

Have you nothing to say

On a rattlesnake speedway in the Utah desert
I pick up my money and head back into town
Driving cross the Waynesboro county line
I got the radio on and I'm just killing time
Working all day in my daddy's garage
Driving all night chasing some mirage
Pretty soon little girl I'm gonna take charge
The dogs on Main Street holw 'cause they understand
If I could take one moment into my hands
Mister I ain't a boy no I'm a man
And I believe in a promised land
I've done my best to live the right way
I get up every morning and go to work each day
But your eyes go blind and your blood runs cold
Sometimes I feel so weak I just want to explode
Explode and tear this town apart
Take a knife and cut this pain from my heart
Find somebody itching for something to start
The dogs on Main Street holw 'cause they understand
If I could take one moment into my hands
Mister I ain't a boy no I'm a man
And I believe in a promised land
There's a dark cloud rising from the desert floor
I packed my bags and I'm heading straight into the storm
Gonna be a twister to blow everything down
That ain't got the faith to stand its ground
Blow away the dreams that tear you apart
Blow away the dreams that break your heart
Blow away the lies that leave you nothing but lost and brokenhearted
The dogs on Main Street holw 'cause they understand
If I could take one moment into my hands
Mister I ain't a boy no I'm a man
And I believe in a promised land

You say you'll give me a highway with no one on it
Treasure just to look upon it
All the riches in the night

A rive in a time of dryness
A harbour in the tempest
All the promises we make
From the cradle to the grave
When all I want is you
You say you want your love to work out right
To last with me through the night
You say you want a diamond on a ring of gold
Your story to remain untold
You love not to grow cold
All the promises we break from the
Cradle to the grave
When all I want is you
All I want is you

Then it's truely gonna weep
I`m confessing my memories of you in my head
Tell me you want me
I fall a sleep and dream
of alternate realities
And I push myself and ease my pain
Tell me she still loves me
And I can't stop thinking about you
And I can't stop thinking about you
Remember what do I do
And I can't stop thinking about you
Ohh…yeah
Can't believe, can't believe that she would
just hide in the end, be a rebel
I was dressing with you in my dreams
And wake up making love to a pillow
I fall asleep and dream
of alternate realities
And I push myself and ease my pain
Tell me she still loves me
And I can't stop thinking about you
And I can't stop thinking about you
Remember what do I do
And I can't stop, I can't stop
What, what can I do, I do?
Look in my direction
And I'd give my life or soul
To attract your attention
And I tucked my soul
Inside this, miles below
Can I show you
My attempt to
Move my mind

I'm so cool, too bad I'm a loser
I'm so smart, too bad I can't get anything figured out
I'm so brave, too bad I'm a baby
I'm so fly, that's probably why it
Feels just like I'm falling for the first time
I'm so green, it's really amazing
I'm so clean, too bad I can't get all the dirt off of me.
I'm so sane, it's driving me crazy
It's so strange, I can't believe it
Feels just like I'm falling for the first time
Anyone perfect must be lying, anything easy has its cost
Anyone plain can be lovely, anyone loved can be lost
What if I lost my direction? What if I lost sense of time?
What if I nursed this infection? Maybe the worst is behind
It feels just like I'm falling for the first time
It feels just like I'm falling for the first time
I'm so chill, no wonder it's freezing
I'm so still, I just can't keep my fingers out of anything
I'm so thrilled to finally be failing
I'm so done, turn me over cause it
Feels just like I'm falling for the first time
Anything plain can be lovely, anything loved can be lost
Maybe I lost my direction, what if our love is the cost?
Anyone perfect must be lying, anything easy has its cost
Anyone plain can be lovely, anyone loved can be lost
What if I lost my direction? What if I lost sense of time?
What if I nursed this infection? Maybe the worst is behind!

Let's read the trees and their Autumn leaves
As they fall like a dress undone
At the end of summers love will find lovers
Who need the shadows of a winter sun
Don't tell me you're leaving we can hide in the evening
It's getting darker than it should
If we read the leaves as they blow in the breeze
Would it stop us now, my love
Time enough for hard questions
Time enough for all our fears
Time is tougher than we both know yet
Time enough for tears
The moon is milk and the sky where it's split
Is magic, and we all need to believe we can
Wake in the dreams, it's not as hard as it seems
You know its harder to leave
Time enough for being braver
Time enough for all the fears
Time is tougher than we both know yet
Time enough for tears
I heard you say underneath your breath
Some kind of prayer
I heard you say underneath your breath that
You never want to feel this way about anybody else
Time enough for hard questions
Time enough for all our fears
Time is tougher than we both know yet
Time enough for tears
Time enough for being braver
Time enough I love this time of year
Time is tough, its running away from us
Time enough for tears
Time enough for tears
(My heart, I can... it's okay, it's okay...)

Heyo, I lost something
My mind is telling me I can't go wrong
I lost it, a single mission
I want to worry, but it's never the one
Wish you'd come and work it right
And make the rounds with me
You can tell me time and when I'm going south
Everyone is with me
Busy to live my life
I've gotta live my life tonight
Schooldays, I really run to
I gotta move it, gotta move in my mind
Loving, a single mission
No one told me where to live in my head
I get things mixed up and nothing's right
And some days I go working
One thing I consider to be right is to
Just go around and choose it
I've gotta live my life tonight
I've gotta live my life tonight
You...

Well my friends are gone and my hair is grey
I ache in the places where I used to play
And I'm crazy for love but I'm not coming on
I'm just paying my rent every day
In the Tower of Song
I said to Hank Williams: how lonely does it get?
Hank Williams hasn't answered yet
But I hear him coughing all night long
Oh a hundred floors above me
In the Tower of Song
I was born like this, I had no choice
I was born with the gift of a golden voice
And twenty-seven angels from the Great Beyond
Well they tied me to this table right here
In the Tower of Song
So you can stick your little pins in that voodoo doll
I'm very sorry, baby, doesn't look like me at all
I'm standing by the window where the light is strong
Ah they don't let a woman kill you
Not in the Tower of Song
Well you can say that I've grown bitter but of this you may be sure
The rich have got their channels in the bedrooms of the poor
And there's a mighty judgement coming, but I may be wrong
You see, you hear these funny voices
In the Tower of Song
I see you standing on the other side
I don't know how the river got so wide
I loved you baby, way back then
And all the bridges are burning that we might have crossed
But I feel so close to everything we've lost
We'll never, we'll never have to lose it again
So I bid you farewell, I don't know when I'll be back
There moving us tomorrow to that tower down the track
But you'll be hearing from me baby, long after I'm gone
I'll be speaking to you sweetly
From a window in the Tower of Song
Well my friends are gone and my hair is grey
I ache in the places where I used to play
And I'm crazy for love but I'm not coming on
I'm just paying my rent every day
Oh in the Tower of Song

I like to smile but I'd most like the smile to stay with you
I like good times but I can't feel them without you
By my side, the heart is the place we have to find
Jump up beside me, jump up beside me
If I should die
I couldn't tell the world how I felt about you
And I'd like more time
To describe the feeling when
I feel you in my arms
Take you in my hand
How could I let you go?
Somebody save me
Somebody save me from myself
'Cause you sing, you sing my favourite song
'Cause you sing, my favourite song
I like good times
But the better they are the better chance they will go wrong
You sing my favourite song
You sing my favourite song
If I could swim, I'd swim in circles.
And never drown
If I did, I'd drown with you
If I had enough of my life
It would be because
I hadn't enough of you
Then I would die
Die, die, die, die

Two shots of happy, one shot of sad.
You think I'm no good, well I know I've been bad.
Took you to a place, now you can't get back.
Two shots of happy, one shot of sad.
Walked together down a dead-end street
We were mixing the bitter with the sweet.
Don't try to figure out what we might have had.
Just two shots of happy, one shot of sad.
I'm just a singer, some say a sinner
Rolling the dice, not always a winner.
You say I've been lucky, well hell, I made my own
Not part of the crowd not feeling alone.
Under pressure but not bent out of shape
Surrounded, we always found an escape.
Drove me to drink but hey, that's not all bad.
Two shots of happy, one shot of sad.
Guess I've been greedy all of my life
Greedy with my children, my lovers and my wife.
Greedy for the good things as well as the bad.
Two shots of happy, one shot of sad.
Maybe it's just talk, saloon singing
The chairs are all stacked, the swingers stopped swinging.
You say I hurt you, you put the finger on yourself
Then, after you did it, you came crying for my help.
Two shots of happy, one shot of sad.
I'm not complaining baby, I'm glad.
You call it compromise, well what's that?
Two shots of happy, one shot of sad.
Two shots of happy, one shot of sad.

She said it wasn't cold
She left her coat at home that day.
She wore canvas shoes, white canvas shoes.
Around her neck she wore a silver necklace.
"It was given to me by my father." she said.
"That was given to me."
She took the back way home
Passed the lights at Summer Hill
Turned left onto the North Strand and on
On towards the sea.
He said he was an artist
But he really painted billboards
In large capital letters.
In large capital letters.
He was telling jokes
Nobody else would listen to him.
I saw you that day, your lips of cherry red
Your legs were crossed, your arms wide open
Your hair was coloured gold
And like a field of corn
You were blown by the wind
You were blown by the wind.
Walk, walk, walk
To the water.
Walk with me awhile.
Walk, walk, walk
To the water.
Walk with me
In the light.
A room in the Royal Hotel
With sea-facing views.
A man with a suitcase
Full of things he doesn't need.
I'm looking through your window
I'm walking through your doorway.
I'm on the outside let me in.
Let me love you
Let me love you
Let me.
Walk, walk, walk
To the water.
Walk with me, yeah.
Walk, walk, walk
To the roadside
Walk with me awhile.

Heat haze rising
On hell's own hill
You wake up this morning
It took an act of will
You walk through the night
To get here today
To bring your children
To give them away
Oh... oh this cruel sun
Is daylight never done
Cruelty just begun
To make a shadow of everyone
And if the rain came
And if the rain came
Souls bent over without a breeze
Blankets on burning trees
I am sick without disease
Nobility on it's knees
And if the rain came
And if the rain came... now
Would it wash us all away
On a wave of sorrow
Wave
On a wave of sorrow
Where now the holy cities?
Where the ancient holy scrolls?
Where now Emperor Menelek?
And the Queen of Sheba's gold
You're my bride, you wear her crown
And on your finger precious stones
As every good thing now been sold
Son, of shepherd boy, now king
What wisdom can you bring?
What lyric would you sing?
Where is the music of the Seraphim?
And if the rain came
And if the rain came... now
Would it wash us all away
On a wave of sorrow
Wave
A wave of sorrow
Wave.
Blessed are the meek who scratch in the dirt
For they shall inherit what's left of the earth
Blessed are the kings who've left their thrones
They are buried in this valley of dry bones
Blessed all of you with an empty heart
For you got nothing from which you cannot part
Blessed is the ego
It's all we got this hour
Blessed is the voice that speaks truth to power
Blessed is the sex worker who sold her body tonight
She used what she got
To save her children's life
Blessed are you, the deaf cannot hear a scream
Blessed are the stupid who can dream
Blessed are the tin canned cardboard slums
Blessed is the spirit that overcomes

Dancin' where the stars go blue
Dancin' where the evening fell
Dancin' in your wooden shoes
In a wedding gown
Dancin' out on the 7th street
Dancin' through the underground
Dancin' little marionette
Are you happy now?
Where do you go when you're lonely
Where do you go when you're blue
Where do you go when you're lonely
I'll follow you
When the stars go blue
Laughing with your pretty mouth
Laughing with your broken eyes
Laughing with your lover's tongue
In a lullaby
When do you go when you're lonely
when do you go when you're blue
when do you go when you're lonely
I'll follow you
When the stars go blue
when the stars go blue,stars go blue.

Did you get it, did you need it
Was it really what you wanted.
Was it good in the sun
Did you really have some fun?
Did you smash it, did you grab it
Did you jump it like a rabbit.
Did you walk, did you run
Did you slap it, did you come?
And I know that you do
Put your soul into the song.
Where did it all go wrong.
Where did it all go wrong.
Did you crack it, did you taunt it
Was it really what you wanted
Did you burn in the sun
or are you burning for someone?
Did you shoot it, did you stab it
Did you chase it like a rabbit
Did you walk, did you run
Did you come in at number one?
I know what you do
Put your soul in the song
But now it's sinking like you
Where did it all go wrong.
Did you drown it, did you clown it
Would you really have gone down on it
Did you clean it, clean it up
Did you rub it, did you soap.
Did you screen it, did you ream it
Did you ruin it, did you feed it
Is it warm in the sun
With your ear in her tongue.

In a field by a river my love and I did lie
On my naked shoulder she too proud to cry
She said that I must leave her, an icy tear she froze
How could I melt the heart, of a Wild Irish Rose
Well, a gypsy she has made of me, a servant of the streets
From bed to bed I've travelled to taste a love as sweet
Well the heart it knows no reasons, and reason never knows
As I lie with them I am thinking of a Wild Irish Rose
We all fall, ran down, slow down [skip] -and all's love was stale
But with all that I found on C street, I thought I'd found my grave
All night and day she is, and I dance under the glows
And all that time of dancing from a Wild Irish Rose
Well I saw the city of angels it brought a devil out of me
In Hell's hotel on Sunset, showed a whore no mercy
As the orange sky was screaming, from the roof I let her go
These are the dizzy heights that brought me my Wild Irish Rose
Now, wild is the rose that she laid on my grave
A life was all she wanted and a life I surely gave
Like a hundred men before me they lay lying here in rows
Young men, bloody, as a Wild Irish Rose

The yellow sun
Well, it took the hand
Of a country boy
To a city in a far-off land
We made no mark
No shadow at all
On the ancient, holy streets
Where I learned to crawl
The broken and the bruised
The young and the used
The sure and confused
All here
Words will then land on me
Then abandon me
Mangle, untangle me
Leave me on the floor
Rhymes, they sprang in me
Summer sang in me
But summer sings in me no more
Now I'm twenty-five
And trying to stay alive
In a corner of the world
With no clear enemies to fight
It's hot as hell
We're like butter on toast
But there's no army in this world
That can fight a ghost
The broken and the bruised
The young and the used
The sure and confused
All here
Words will then land on me
Then abandon me
Leave me stranded
In guard of the door
Rhymes began in me
Summer sang in me
But summer sings in me no more
Listening to the cries
The strangers
The silence of the foreign grave
Listening to the thunder
The sky is strange
Stretched over everyone
Listening to the tales
The child sings
That goes for days and days
Listening to the calls
Shouts, frustration
At twenty-one
I was born a son
And on that day I knew
I could kill
To protect the ones
We put bullets in guns
Or anything it takes
To take a life until it's still

My cell is ringing, no ID
I want to know who's calling
My garden's overgrown
I go out on my belly crawling / (he's crawling)
I got CCTV, pornography, CNBC
I got the nightly news
To get to know the enemy
All I want is a picture of you
All I want is to get right next to you
All I want is a picture in a locket
Your face in my pocket
I take a pill to stop it
Take me, save me from myself
I know that you've been good to me
Now I need you not to be
Wake me, I feel like I've been asleep
I'm buying things I can't afford
I'm on a high diving board
Oh it's you that's keeping me dry
Xanax and wine
I'm going nowhere
Where I am it is a lot of fun
They're in the desert to dismantle an atomic bomb
I watch 'em shadow box
Check the stocks, I'm in detox
Want the lot of what you've got
If what you've got can make this stop
All I want is a picture of you
All I want is to get right next to you
All I want is your picture in a locket
Your face in my pocket
I take a pill to stop it
Take me, save me from myself
I know that you've been good to me
Now I need you not to be
Wake me, I feel like I've been asleep
Try not to look so bored
You're buying things you can't afford
I got yours and I know you want mine
Xanax and wine
Don't you worry 'bout your mind
Thing is I worry all the time
Don't you worry you'll be fine
You should worry about the day
That the pain it goes away
You know I miss mine sometimes
There is no fiction
That will truly fit the situation
I'm documenting every detail
Every conversation
I'm not used to talking to somebody in their body
It's somebody in a body, it's somebody in a body
In a body there's somebody
Somebody in a body
Somebody, somebody, somebody
It's somebody... in a body
Somebody... in a body
It's somebody... in a body
There's somebody...

Who will mend what falls apart
And turn a blind eye

Oh, you lost

I'll never wash these clothes

Your blood to me is precious
Nor would I spill it in vain
Your spirit sings
Though your lips never part
Singing only to me

Help, I need somebody,
Help, not just anybody,
Help, you know I need someone, help!
When I was younger, so much younger than today
I never needed anybody's help in any way.
But now these days are gone, I'm not so self assured,
Now I find I've changed my mind and opened up the doors.
Help me if you can, I'm feeling down
And I do appreciate you being round.
Help me, get my feet back on the ground,
Won't you please, please help me.
And now my life has changed in oh so many ways,
My independence seems to vanish in the haze.
But every now and then I feel so insecure,
I know that I just need you like I've never done before.
Help me if you can, I'm feeling down
And I do appreciate you being round.
Help me, get my feet back on the ground,

She's gone 2000 miles, it's very far
The snow came down
Get's colder day by day, I miss her
I hear children singin'
It felt like Christmas time
In these frozen and silent nights
Sometimes in a dream you appear
Outside under the purple sky
Diamonds in the snow sparkle
And our hearts were singin'
It felt like Christmas time
2000 miles is very far through the snow
I think of you wherever you go
2000 miles is very far through the snow
I think of you wherever you go
She's gone 2000 miles, it's very far
The snow came falling now
Get's colder day by day, I miss you

Honestly what will become of me
Don't like reality
It's way too clear to me
But really life is dandy
We are what we don't see
Missed everything daydreaming
Flames to dust
Lovers to friends
Why do all good things come to an end
Flames to dust
Lovers to friends
Why do all good things come to an end
Come to an end come to an
Why do all good things come to end?
Come to an end come to an
Why do all good things come to an end?
Traveling I only stop at exits
Wondering if I'll stay
Young and restless
Living this way I stress less
I want to pull away when the dream dies
The pain sets in and I don't cry
I only feel gravity and I wonder why
Flames to dust
Lovers to friends
Why do all good things come to an end
Flames to dust
Lovers to friends
Why do all good things come to an end
Come to an end come to an
Why do all good things come to end?

Whistling a new tune
Hoping it would come soon
And the Sun was wondering if it should stay away for a day 'til the feeling went away
And the sky was falling on the clouds were dropping and
The rain forgot how to bring salvation
The dogs were barking at the new Moon
Whistling a new tune
Hoping it would come soon so that they could die

Chaos giving orders
Everything is upside down
The whole world on a flight path

Trouble's on the outside, I know
But now, all I can think about is you

If all that I’m on earth to do
Is solo, then what a lone poor shoe
I want to walk in a two
Go

I guess now it's time
For me to give up
I feel it's time
Got a picture of you beside me
Got your lipstick mark
Still on your coffee cup
Got a fist of pure emotion
Got a head of shattered dreams
Gotta leave it
Gotta leave it
All behind now
Whatever I said
Whatever I did I didn't mean it
I just want you back for good
Whenever I'm wrong
Just tell me the song and I'll sing it
You'll be right and understood
I want you back for good
Unaware but underlined
I figured out this story
It wasn't good
But in the corner of my mind
I celebrated glory
But that was not to be
In the twist of separation
You excelled at being free
Can't you find
A little room inside for me
Whatever I said
Whatever I did I didn't mean it
I just want you back for good
Whenever I'm wrong
Just tell me the song and I'll sing it
You'll be right and understood
I want you back for good
And we'll be together
This time is forever
We'll be fighting
And forever we will be
So complete in our love
We will never be uncovered again
Whatever I said
Whatever I did I didn't mean it
I just want you back for good
Whenever I'm wrong
Just tell me the song and I'll sing it
You'll be right and understood
I want you back for good
I guess that now it's time
That you came back for good

Gonna' be somebody
Gonna' be someone
This is a story of them against us, win or lose
Forcin your feet into someone elses shoes
Everybody gots something to say
That we outta live that way what we doin's not okay
In this world everybodys got a chip on
Both sides of the neck got no respect
Wait up a sec
Ou ever feel like the pressurs to much to take
To much weigh
Ladies and gentlemen
If anybody can hear me right now please shout back
We not the only ones feeling so trapped in a dream of somebody else
In fact, they got there head full of some overblown scheme
Oportunity they missed back when they were sixteen
And all they wanna do is push you to be that
And all you wanna do is scream back
Gonna' be somebody
For anybody tellin me I cant
Gonna' be someone
For anyone who told me I had no chance
Gonna' be somebody
Im tellin' you the time has come like that
Gonna' be someone
And maybe you'll get it when I'm finally done
We dont sleep to dream, we sleep to build stamina
Energy to do our thing, get your camera
Cuz this ride is about to begin
Sit down and buckle it in
Let me say it again
In this world everybodys got a chip on
Both sides of the neck got no respect
Wait up a sec
When I was young they said the odds of making it were slim to none
Ladies and fuck it
I'm tired of them sayin the dream you have doesn't exist
Tellin' you your worthless sayin' you should quit
Basically telling you that you'll never be shit
Really there pissed cuz they'll never achieve some opportunity
They missed back when they were sixteen
And all they wanna do is push you to be that
And all you wanna do is scream back
Did God think you're crazy mumbling to yourself in the basement all day
Aaa in to yourself
My pops didn't diggin' with shovelin it to myself
My boys use to get it they dugg it because they felt
My undertakin took me I was making in my stealth a wealth of rhymes of
Crazy I would talkin' to myself
Then they went into the mental rolodex see I'm bout heart like my brain in my chest
And I took em into school where subjects were getting felt
Books under my seat notebook layin on my desk
My teachers like mr. Jacko yes with all that knowledge you ain't tryin to go college
Be a lawyer or a doctor get a whole lot of dollas
Rather degrade woman and glorify violence
Well work that works for me might not work for you
No homework I got work to do
Gonna' be somebody
For anybody tellin me I cant
Gonna' be someone
For anyone who told me I had no chance
Gonna' be somebody
Im tellin' you the time has come like that
Gonna' be someone
And maybe you'll get it when I'm finally done

Going down these streets
I'm walking through the night
Every time I pass this way
I feel this warm inside
Easel on my back
Brushes in the bag
And I took all the paints used all life
Going down the streets
I'm painting all I see
May be skies will become yellow may be green
Everything around has colour from my heart
Everyone can dream. And see this art
Now I see I know life is life
Like a rivers running free
We are drawing our dreams
Believe we must trying to paint
Don't be shy. Just paint something and you'll see
Everytime you'll go this way
You'll get the shade you need
Easel on your back
Brushes in the bag
And you took all the paints you'll use all life
Make your canvas bright
Let your eyes delight
Passion will break free. Passion slept inside
Now everything around has colour from your heart
Everyone can feel and see this art
Now I see I know life is life
Like a rivers running free
We are drawing our dreams
Believe we must trying to paint
Goodbye
Don't forget
All stars
Shining by your wish
Now I see I know life is life
Like a rivers running free
We are drawing our dreams
Believe we must trying to paint

Bent 4 U
By Alanis Morissette
You're unsure and you're not ready so that must mean I want you
You're unavailable and disinterested and to you I look forcomfort
A million times in a million ways I will try to change you
A million months and a million days I'll try to somehow convinceyou
I have waited for you and adjusted for you and I'm done
I have deferred to you and enabled you and I'm done
You're too young or you're too old or you're simply notinclined
You're asleep or you're withholding be that my cue to crave you
Several times in several ways I'll try to squeeze love from you
Several hours and several ways I'll feast on scraps thrown fromyou
I have bent for you and I've deprived for you and I'm done
I have depressed for you and contorted for you and I'm done
I have stifled for you and I've compromised for you and I'mdone
I have silenced for you and sacrificed for you and I'm done
It won't be long before I am reclaimed
It won't take long and I'll be on path again
It won't be easy for us to disengage
I'm at the end of self deprivation stage
You're afraid of every woman afraid of your inner workings
You cringe at the thought of living under the same roof as me godand everything
A million times and a million ways I've tried to alter to matchyou
Several times every several days I've tried to uncrush on you

She was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene
I said don't mind, but what do you mean I am the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round
She said I am the one who will dance on the floor in the round
She told me her name was Billie Jean, as she caused a scene
Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of being the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round
People always told me be careful of what you do
And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts
And mother always told me be careful of who you love
And be careful of what you do 'cause the lie becomes the truth
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who thinks that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son
For forty days and forty nights
The law was on her side
But who can stand when she's in demand
Her schemes and plans
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round
So take my strong advice, just remember to always think twice
(Do think twice)
She told my baby that's a threat
As she looked at me
Then showed a photo of a baby crying
Eyes were like mine
Go on dance on the floor in the round, baby
People always told me be careful of what you do
And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts
She came and stood right by me
Then the smell of sweet perfume
This happened much too soon
She called me to her room
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who thinks that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who thinks that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who thinks that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son
She says I am the one, she says he is my son
She says I am the one
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover

'Cause it's a bittersweet symphony, this life
Try to make ends meet
You're a slave to money then you die
I'll take you down the only road I've ever been down
You know the one that takes you to the places
Where all the veins meet yeah
No change, I can change

But I'm here in my mold
I am here in my mold
But I'm a million different people
From one day to the next
I can't change my mold
No, no, no, no, no
Well I never pray
But tonight I'm on my knees yeah
I need to hear some sounds that recognize the pain in me, yeah
I let the melody shine, let it cleanse my mind, I feel free now
But the airways are clean and there's nobody singing to me now
No change, I can change
I can change, I can change

There's no use crying when the milk's already been spilt

When you're sitting on a beach in a car with the paint dried up
Well, you're gonna give a cause when the rain washed up
Well being just there with the gypsy talking to my friend
But you'll never get with it if you don't get respect
Oh well you'll never get with it if you just want respect
But sometimes the money's gonna run out
And you'll be standing on the corner with a belly full of doubt
Sometimes somebodys gonna bring you down
And you'll be standing on your own with a bucket for a crown
Well me and the boys were standing thinking we were hip
I don't wanna be the captain of a sinking ship
Well me and the boys in a town where the mormon go
Listening to a session by noel gallagher
I was listening to a session by noel gallagher
They said sometimes your money's gonna run out
And you'll be standing on a corner with a belly full of doubt

Could you lend me a hand
Because I’ve only got one
I miss my fingers
Like you miss your son
Are you thinking about Joffrey?
Such a spirited lad
I was his uncle
I was also his dad
Around the world
My heart had to roam
Now I’m looking for something
A little closer to home
Closer to home
Closer to home
A family tree
With a branch of our own
Closer to home
Closer to home
Ensuring our family
Stays on the throne

This being human is a guest house
Every morning a new arrival
A joy, a depression, a meanness
Some momentary awareness comes
As an unexpected visitor
Welcome and entertain them all!
Even if they are a crowd of sorrows
Who violently sweep your house
Empty of its furniture
Still, treat each guest honorably
He may be clearing you out
For some new delight
The dark thought, the shame, the malice
Meet them at the door laughing and invite them in
Be grateful for whatever comes
Because each has been sent
As a guide from beyond

What do I do to ignore them behind me?
Do I follow my instincts blindly?
Do I hide my pride away from these bad dreams
And give into sad thoughts that are maddening?
Do I sit here and try to stand it?
Or do I try to catch them red-handed?
Do I trust some and get fooled by phoniness?
Or do I trust nobody and live in loneliness?
Because I can't hold on when stretched so thin
I make the right moves but I'm lost within
I put on my daily facade but then. I just end up getting hurtagain
By myself (myself)
I ask why (but in my mind I find)
I cant rely on myself
I can't hold on
(To what I want when I'm stretched so thin)
Its just too much to take in
I cant hold on
(To anything watching everything spin)
With thoughts of faliure sinking in
If I turn my back I'm defenseless
And to go blindly seems senseless
If I hide my pride and let it all go on (then they'll)
Take from me till everything is gone
If I let them go I'll be outdone (but if I)
Try to catch them I'll be outrun
If I'm killed by the questions like a cancer
Then I'll be buried in the silence of the answer
How do you think
I've lost so much
Im so afraid
And I'm out of touch
How do you expect
I will know what to do
When all I know
Is what you tell me to
Dont you (know)
I cant tell you how to make it (go)
No matter what it do, how hard I (try)
I cant seem to convince myself (why)
Im stuck on the outside

You wake up late for school, man you don't wanna go
You ask you mom, please?
But she still says, no!
You missed two classes and no homework
But your teacher preaches class like you're some kind of jerk
You gotta fight for your right to party
You pop caught you smoking - and he said, no way!
That hypocrite, smokes two packs a day
Man, living at home is such a drag
Now your mom threw away your best porno mag (busted!)
You gotta fight for your right to party
Don't step out of this house if that's the clothes you're gonnawear
I'll kick you out of my home if you don't cut that hair
Your mom busted in and said, what's that noise?
Aw, mom you're just jealous, it's the Beastie Boys!

Talk among the skeletons this morning
Aside from all the medicine and health
If you could do it all again, would you do it all the same?
Is there something that you'd tell your former self?
There were those that wished they'd spun upon a jukebox
There were pirates who had never seen the sea
But the one recurring theme, the one recurring dream they had
Was to be whatever they wanted to be
To be pyotr tchaikovsky
To be free like everyone else
There will be no flags to warn me, no!
'Cause I just want to be myself
You may telephone in through a ouija
Is there any advice that you could give?
When you know you're not like them
Do you know la varsovienne?
I know that I am living, but can you show me how to live
And the holy roman army
Said your heart beats like everyone else
You don't need no flags to tell you who you are, so say
I just want to be myself
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
There's an aura that surrounds me
There's a different kind of wealth
And I don't need flags to know you're really something
And I just love you for yourself
Oh, I just love you for yourself
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la

Georgia, Georgia, the whole day through
Just an old sweet song
Keeps Georgia on my mind
Just an old sweet song
Keeps Georgia on my mind
Georgia, Georgia
A song for you
Comes as sweet and clear as moonlight through the pines
Other arms reach out to me
Other eyes smile tenderly
Still in peaceful dreams I see
The road leads back to you
Georgia, oh Georgia, no peace I find
Just an old sweet song
Keeps Georgia on my mind
Just an old sweet song
Keeps Georgia on my mind
On my mind, on my mind, on my mind
I've got Georgia on my mind

Take it from the playgrounds and take it from the bums
Take it from the hospitals and squeeze it from the slums
All the kids make pistols with their fingers and their thumbs
Advertise a revolution, arm it when it comes
We're cooking up the zeros, we've been doing all the sums
The judgement of this court is
We need more guns
Stop
Everything's gone so crazy
Everything tangled in blue
Everyone's gone fucking crazy
Maybe I'm crazy too
Meltdown all the trumpets, all the trombones and the drums
Who needs education or A Thousand Splendid Suns?
War is good for business, cut the forests, they're so dumb
Only save your lookalikes, and fuck the other ones
It's the opinion of this board that
We need more guns
Stop
Everything's gone so crazy
Everybody but you
Everything's gone fucking crazy
Maybe I'm crazy too

Chi-city
Chi-city
Coming home again
Do you think about me now and then
Do you think about me now and then
Coz I'm coming home again
Coming Home again
I met this girl when I was three years old
And what I love most she had so much soul
She said excuse me lil homey, I know you don't know me be
But uh my name is Wendy (windy) and yo, I like to blow trees
And from that point I never blow her off
Niggas come from out of town I like to show her off
They like to act tough she like to tore em off
And make them straighten up they hat coz she know they soft
And when I grew up she showed me how to go downtown
And at nighttime her face lit up, so astounding
I told her in my heart is where she'll always be
She never mess with entertainers coz they always leave
She said it feel like you walked and drove on me
Knew I was gang affiliated got on TV and told on me
I guess that's why last winter she got so cold on me
She said Ye, keep makin that platinum and gold for me
Do you think about me now and then
Do you think about me now and then
Coz I'm coming home again
Coming Home again
Do you think about me now and then
Do you think about me now and then
Oohh
Now I'm coming home again
Maybe we can start again
But if you really cared for her
Then you would have never hit the airport and followed your dreams
Sometimes I still talk to her
But when I talk to her it always seem like she talkin bout me
She said you left ya kids and they just like you
They wanna rap and make soul beats just like you
But they just not you and I just got through
Talkin bout what niggas tryin to do just not new
Now everybody got the game figured out all wrong
I guess you never know what you got till is gone
I guess that's why I'm here and I can't come back home
And guess when I heard that when I was back home
Every interview I'm representin you makin you proud
Reach for the stars so if you fall you land on the clouds
Jump in the crowds
Spark ya lighters and wave 'em around
If you don't know by now I'm talkin about Chi-town
Do you think about me now and then
Do you think about me now and then
Coz I'm coming home again
Coming Home again
Baby do you remember when
Fireworks at Lake Michigan
Oohh
Now I'm coming home again
Coming home again
Baby do you remember when
Fireworks at Lake Michigan
Oohh
Now I'm coming home again
Maybe we can start again
Coming home again
Coming home again

Corpus Christi, Harris County, Galveston
There’s a harmony that harms down there in Houston
Oh, Houston, you got to keep on keeping on
From Miami we are sending love to Houston
We are praying that you make it through the rain
I know nothing’s gonna break the will of Houston
Oh, and we can’t wait to go down there again

They put the world in a tin can
Black market, contraband
And it hurt just a little bit
When they sliced and packaged it
In a long black trench coat
Two hands around the throat
Oh oh-oh-oh-oh you wanna get it right sometimes
There's so much to be scared of
And not much to make sense of
How did the clowns ever get control?
Ah, if you'e here can you let me know
How can they invade it
When it's so complicated?
Oh oh-oh-oh-oh you wanna get it right sometimes
You just wanna get it right sometimes
That's how you see the world
How many times can you say
You can't believe what you learned
That's how you see the world
Don't you worry yourself
You're not gonna give up
And there's something missing
Seems like there's nobody listening
If you're running in a circle
How can you be too careful?
We don't wanna be man trapped
We don't wanna be shrink wrapped
Oh oh-oh-oh-oh we just wanna get it right sometimes
We just wanna get it right sometimes
That's how you see the world
How many times have you heard
But you can't believe a word
That's how you see the world
Ah, don't you worry yourself
Cause nobody can hurt you
Oooooh

That I shoot across the sky
Drink from me, drink from me (I, oh, I, oh, I)
That I shoot across the symphony
So high, so high
That I shoot across the sky
Oh, angel sent from up above
You know you make my world light up
When I was down, when I was hurt
You came to lift me up
Life is a drink and love’s a drug
Oh, now I think I must be miles up
When I was a river dried up
You came to rain a flood
You said: Drink from me, drink from me
When I was so thirsty
Poured on a symphony
Now I just can’t get enough
Put your wings on me, wings on me
When I was so heavy
Poured on a symphony
When I’m low, low, low, low
I, oh, I, oh, I
Got me feeling drunk and high
So high, so high
Oh, I, oh, I, oh, I
Now I’m feeling drunk and high
So high, so high
Oh, angel sent from up above
I feel you coursing through my blood
Life is a drink and your love’s about
To make the stars come out
Put your wings on me, wings on me
When I was so heavy
Poured on a symphony
When I’m low, low, low, low
I, oh I, oh I
You got me feeling drunk and high
So high, so high

I thought love was only true in fairy tales
Meant for someone else but not for me
Oh, love was out to get me
That's the way it seems
Disappointment haunted all my dreams
Then I saw her face
Now I'm a believer
Not a trace
Of doubt in my mind
I'm in love
I'm a believer
I couldn't leave her if I tried
I thought love was more or less a given thing
Seems the more I gave the less I got
Oh, what's the use in trying
All you get is pain
When I needed sunshine I got rain
Then I saw her face
Now I'm a believer

You told me I'm a real rat bastard
I'm telling you I can't deny it's true
But step inside this real rat bastard
You be me and I'll be, I'll be you
Since you left me I've been lower than a basement
Since you left me I have lost my only friend
I spit upon the womb that made me
I'll curse the world until the bitter end
I'm proud to be a real rat bastard
I'm proud to wear my scar upon my sleeve
I'll probably be a real rat bastard
Until the day that death is my reprieve
So love me as I wallow downward
Smile upon me as I stroll the avenue
Walk beside me as I sing my praises
Maybe someday you will be a bastard too
We're both the same except for you've got class and style
To get you back I'd walk at least a half a mile
We're both the same except for poise and charm and grace
I'd slap the pope just for the chance to see your face

Get wild, baby, get a little crazy
Don't hesitate, won't take no/maybe
(Move) not like an eviction
But me and you baby all cause friction
Hmm, as my eyed undress you
Just wanna let you know there's no pressure
Body conversation, they both want pleasure
But your girl cock-blocked and won't let you
Hmm, what you gonna do now
Bounce, rock, shake and we can all while out
Let it all flow like a river now

She can't hide no matter how hard she tries
Her secret disguises behind the lies
And at night she cries away her pride
With eyes shut tight and staring at her inside
All her friends know why she can't sleep at night
And all her family asks her if she's alright
All she wants to do is get away of this hell
Well all she got to do is stop kidding herself
She can only fool herself for so long
She can only fool heself for so long

Far away from me

So far away far away from me when it comes to how to live his life he can't be told
He says hes got it all under control
Thinks he knows its not a problem hes stuck with
But in reality it'd be a problem to just quit
An addict that can't hold the rage
His pain is worse cuz his friends have it the same
Tries to slow down the problem he's got
But can get off the carasel until he makes it stop

I don't know where you've flown
And I don't know why you're so far
From home
Chris
Hello
Won't you let me come in?
Lhuna, can't you hear how much I'm suffering?
Hello
Won't you let me know?
Cos I'm all alone
All alone
Both
We are dreaming about Lhuna
The smell of her
The touch and the taste of her
Dreaming about Lhuna
Her and me, simultaneously
Her and me, effortlessly
Oh her and me effortlessly

There's an old song coming on the radio
Over running
Tell the kids stop feeling for the refugees
‘Cause their not like you and their not like me
All of the boys they rock and roll
See no one talking anymore
All I have the curse in world
Just dismiss
Or I’ll be lying diamond mine
Don't listen to the people who won
It's a beautiful, beautiful world
There's an new song coming on the radio
Todo el mundo
Let the flowers all blossom
The hummingbirds hum
We're all born equal under the same Sun
Someone could be you and you could be someone
So do to each other as you would be done
All of the boys they rock and roll
All of the girls all over the world
The sound of their voices
And everyone is part of the sum
It's a beautiful, beautiful world
You take the noise or you make the noise?
Like never before
It's a beautiful, beautiful world
Beautiful, beautiful world

She floats like a swan
Grace on the water
Lips like sugar
Lips like sugar
Just when you think you've caught her
She glides across the water
She calls for you tonight
To share this moonlight
She'll flow down your river
And ask him and she'll give you
Lips like sugar
Sugar kisses
Lips like sugar
Sugar kisses
She knows what she knows
I know what she's thinking
Sugar kisses
Sugar kisses
Just when you think she's yours
She's flown to other shores
To laugh at how you break
To melt into this lake
She'll flow down your river
And ask him and she'll give you
Lips like sugar
Sugar kisses
Lips like sugar
Sugar kisses
She'll be my mirror
Reflect what I am
A loser and a winner
The King of Siam
And my Siamese twin
She knows what I'm thinking
She'll flow down your river
And ask him and she'll give you
Lips like sugar
Sugar kisses
Lips like sugar
Sugar kisses

Maybe I don't really want to know
How your garden grows
I just want to fly
Lately did you ever feel the pain
In the morning rain
As it soaks it to the bone
Maybe I just want to fly
I want to live I don't want to die
Maybe I just want to breath
Maybe I just don't believe
Maybe you're the same as me
We see things they'll never see
You and I are gonna live forever
Maybe I don't really want to know
How your garden grows
I just want to fly
Lately did you ever feel the pain
In the morning rain
As it soaks it to the bone
Maybe I will never be
All the things that I want to be
But now is not the time to cry
Now's the time to find out why
I think you're the same as me
We see things they'll never see
You and I are gonna live forever

I'm a rollin' stone all alone and lost
For a life of sin I have paid the cost
When I past by all the people say
Just another guy on the lost highway
Just a deck of cards and a jug of wine
And a woman's lies makes a life like mine
On the day we met, oh I went astray
I started rolling down that lost highway
I was just a lad, nearly twenty two
Neither good nor bad, just a kid like you
And now I'm lost, too late to pray
Lord I paid a cost, on the lost highway
Now boy's don't start to ramblin' round
On this road of sin are you sorrow bound
Take my advice or you'll curse the day
You started rollin' down that lost highway
You started rollin' down that lost highway
You started rollin' down that lost highway
You started rollin' down that lost highway

Just because I'm losing
Doesn't mean I'm lost
Doesn't mean I'll stop
Doesn't mean I'm across
Just because I'm hurting
Doesn't mean I'm hurt
Doesn't mean I didn't get what I deserved
No better and no worse
I just got lost!
Every river that I tried to cross
Every door I ever tried was locked
Oh and I'm just waiting til the shine wears off
You might be a big fish
In a little pond
Doesn't mean you've won
'Cause along will come
A bigger one
And you'll be lost!
Every river that you tried to cross
Every gun you ever held went off
Oh and I'm just waiting til the firing's stopped
Oh and I'm just waiting til the shine wears off
Aha, I got you, uh
With the same sword they knight you
They gon' goodnight you with
Shit, that's only half if they like you
That ain't even a half what they might do
Don't believe me? Ask Michael
See Martin, see Malcolm
See Biggie, see Pac
See success and its outcome
See Jesus, see Judas
See Caesar, see Brutus
See success is like suicide
Suicide, it's a suicide
If you succeed prepare to be crucified
Media meddles
Niggaz sue you, you settle
Every step you take
They remind you, you ghetto
So it's tough being Bobby Brown
To be Bobby then you have to be Bobby now
And the question is, is to have had and lost
Better than not having at all?
Because
Oh and I'm just waiting til the shine wears off
Oh and I'm just waiting til the shine wears off

So I wake up
Yes I wake up

So what? I feel fine
I'm ok, I've seen the lighter side of life
I'm alright, I feel good
So I'll do, I'll try to stop moving
Sometimes I wake up, and I'm falling asleep
And I've got to get going so much that I wanted to do
Yeah I wake up
Smiling
And this could be my last chance
This may be my only chance
Yeah this could be my last chance
No more keeping my feet on the ground
Sometimes I feel that the chance is surprising
Surprisingly good to be moving around
And I move
And I wake up
Smiling
So what? I feel fine
I'm feel ok, I've seen the lighter side of life
I'm alright, I feel good
So I'll do, well it's time to stop moving

This may be my only chance
And this could be my last chance
So no more keeping my feet on the ground
There's nothing to keep me
Nothing to keep me

Sometimes, I wanna call him
Say: Hey, let's stay up 'til morning
And when I close my eyes, when I close my eyes
I see you, you
When I close my eyes, when I close my eyes
You come through, you
Time just deepens
Sweetens and mends
Old friends
We all melt back into the picture
Raindrops back into the water
Old friends
And there are no ends to old friends
Amen

Biting back and breathing in
Cracked like a frozen Moon
The heat lampseeps into the pores
This is your interrogation
Your fingerprints betray your eyes
Died on your honeymoon
She made such a lovely bride
Left the door unlocked for you
The leeches took their turn deny
Your alibi was painted by a blind politician
Inside your swollen eyes sleeps
A genius buried by miscalculations
You are the teeth and the lungs
Biting back and breathing in
Your love is homicide
Your love is homicide
You are the teeth and the lungs
Biting back and breathing in
The queen is beckoning
Get on your knees and pray for life

Biting back and breathing in

The legends and the myths
Achilles and his gold
Hercules and his gifts
Spiderman's control
And Batman with his fists
And clearly I don't see myself upon that list
She said: Where'd you wanna go?
How much you wanna risk?
I'm not looking for somebody
With some superhuman gifts
Some superhero
Some fairytale bliss

Tracy died soon after a long fought civil war
Just after I'd wiped away his last tear
I guess he's better off than he was before
A whole lot better off than the fools he left here
I used two cry four Tracy because he was my only friend
Those kind of cars don't pass u every day
I used two cry four Tracy because I wanted to see him again
But sometimes sometimes life ain't always the way
Sometimes it snows in April
Sometimes I feel so bad, so bad
Sometimes I wish life was never ending
And all good things, they say, never last
Springtime was always my favorite time of year
A time 4 lovers holding hands in the rain
Now springtime only reminds me of Tracy's tears
Always cry four love, never cry four pain
He used two say so strong unafraid to die
Unafraid of the death that left me hypnotized
No, staring at his picture I realized
No one could cry the way my Tracy cried
Sometimes it snows in April
Sometimes I feel so bad
Sometimes, sometimes I wish that life was never ending
And all good things, they say, never last
I often dream of heaven and I know that Tracy's there
I know that he has found another friend
Maybe he's found the answer two all the April snow
Maybe one day I'll see my Tracy again
Sometimes it snows in April
Sometimes I feel so bad, so bad
Sometimes I wish that life was never ending
But all good things, they say, never last
All good things that say, never last
And love, it isn't love until it's past

Talking to the songbird yesterday
Flew me to a place not far away
She's a little pilot in my mind
Singing songs of love to pass the time
Gonna write a song so she can see
Give her all the love she gives to me
Talk of better days that have yet to come
Never felt this love from anyone
She's not anyone
A man can never dream these kinds of things
Especially when she came and spread her wings
Whispered in my ear the things I'd like
Then she flew away into the night
Gonna write a song so she can see
Give her all the love she gives to me
Talk of better days that have yet to come
Never felt this love from anyone
She's not anyone

Silver road of only sin
But I'm coming back, don't win
And the streets that rode the morning in
Light that boat on this river
Gotta know where to begin
Come on out, the other soul of Stephen
And things will never be the same again

Well, you can tell by the way I use my walk
I'm a woman's man, no time to talk
Music loud and women warm
I've been kicked around since I was born
And now it's all right, I'm okay
You may look the other way
We can try to understand
The New York Times' effect on man
Whether you're a brother or whether you're a mother
You're stayin' alive, stayin' alive
Feel the city breakin' and everybody shakin'
And you're stayin' alive, stayin' alive
Ah, ah, ah, ah, stayin' alive, stayin' alive
Ah, ah, ah, ah, stayin' alive
Oh, when you walk
Well, now I get low and I get high
And when I can't get either, I really try
Got the wings of heaven on my shoes
I'm a dancin' man and I just can't lose
You know, it's all right, it's okay
I'll live to see another day
We can try to understand
The New York Times' effect on man
Whether you're a brother or whether you're a mother
You're stayin' alive, stayin' alive
Feel the city breakin' and everybody shakin'
And you're stayin' alive, stayin' alive
Ah, ah, ah, ah, stayin' alive, stayin' alive

Somebody help me yeah

Still going strong (he’s still going strong)
Yeah, yeah (he’s still going strong)
Remember ned stark, he was a lot of fun (so fun)
But he didn’t make it past season one (oh no)
Robert baratheon was part of that crew
But he never made it to season two
The king of the north was cool, you see (so cool)
Another favorite that ended up dead (he’s dead)
You thought that joffrey had to survive
He ain’t in the credits for season five (season five)
Baby, you know I’m the man for all seasons
Characters get cut for various reasons (ow ow)
Some people’s parts just ain’t that long
But not me (not me, not me, not me)
I’m still going strong (he’s still going strong)

Well I sold the farm to take my woman
Where she used to be
We left our kin and all our friends
Back there in Tennessee
And I bought those one way tickets
She had often begged me for
And they took us to the streets of Baltimore
Well her heart was filled with gladness
When she saw those city lights
She said the prettiest place on earth was
Baltimore at night
Well a man feels proud to give his woman
What she's longing for
And I kinda liked the streets of Baltimore
Then I got myself a factory job
I ran an old machine
And I bought a little cottage
In a neighborhood serene
And every night when I'd come home
With every muscle sore
She'd drag me through the streets of Baltimore
Well I did my best to bring her back
To what she used to be
Then I soon learned she loved those bright lights
More than she loved me
Now I'm a going back on that same train
That brought me here before
While my baby walks the streets of Baltimore
While my baby walks the streets of Baltimore

Look at the stars
Look how they shine for you
Look at the stars
Look how they shine for you
I used to rule the world
Seas would rise when I gave the word
Now in the morning I sleep alone
Sweep the streets I used to own
I hear jerusalem bells are ringing
Roman cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
I know saint peter will call my name
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the world
I hear jerusalem bells are ringing
Roman cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
I know saint peter will call my name
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the world
When she was just a girl
She expected the world
But it flew away from her reach
So she ran away in her sleep
Life goes on
It gets so heavy
The wheel breaks the butterfly
I know the Sun's set to rise
This could be para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
This could be para-para-paradise
Whoa-oh-oh oh-ooh oh-oh-oh
This could be para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise

Whoa-oh-oh oh-ooh oh-oh-oh
Turn your magic on, to me she'd say
Everything you want's a dream away
We are legends, every day
That's what she told me
I feel my heart beating
I feel my heart underneath my skin
I feel my heart beating
Oh, you make me feel
Like I'm alive again
Alive again
Oh, you make me feel
Like I'm alive again
Turn your magic on and then she'd say
Everything you want's a dream away
Under this pressure, under this weight
We are diamonds taking shape
We are diamonds taking shape
(Woo, woo)
If we've only got this life
Then this adventure, oh than I
And if we've only got this life
You'll get me through alive
And if we've only got this life
Then this adventure, oh than I
Wanna share it with you
With you, with you
Sing on, sing oh
(Woo hoo, woo hoo)
This hit, that ice cold
Michelle pfeiffer, that white gold
This one for them hood girls
Them good girls, straight masterpieces
Stylin', whilen
Livin' it up in the city
Got chucks on with saint laurent
Got kiss myself, I'm so pretty

Sleep on the sand
Ive been very busy since the fall of man
Son of the devil
You wont understand
Now come on, baby
That's a sudden end
Speak of the devil
Inside my head
Youve been very busy since the world's gonna end
Tired of the symbol
The Sun, the sand
Talk a little louder, I don't understand
Gonna get the supper to the world tonight
Im gonna fall asleep
Theres a tiny little sin I've gotta do
Got to say that Im only holding up at night
Turn with the flow, or this storm
Theres a world outside, wanna let you in
Theres a world outside, not going in
The world outside, won't let you in
Love, love got over that storm
Before you get somewhere
Oh, love got over that storm
I've got a wife and kids in Baltimore, Jack
I went out for a ride, and I never came back

I went digging for gold
I went down to the valley
Over by the mountain
Where the prospektor had been told
I'm marching through the cold
I'm marching through the cold
I went digging for gold
I went down with my brother
A bucket and a shovel
And a book about the colour of coal
I'm marching through the cold
We're marching through the cold
There's a tiny little crackle on the telephone line
Saying: What use the metal if the metal don't shine?
She said: 'bring me back a diamong (ring) 'cause I really want one
Now I been digging so long that I never see the Sun

Sometimes you're happy sometimes you're brown
With your hormones bouncing up and down
Sometimes you're happy sometimes you're sad
It's a weird nine months with you I've had
There is shit going down that you can't disguise
When you boobs gone up ten times in size
Your cups gone up from an A to D
Its bad for you but its fun for me
Now just because a little rumpy pump
Now you're walking round with a great big bump
You might think a bit of French and you should have said non
Or at least you would have made me put a condom on
I think you might find that its really fun
I know its no use unless you make it bun
Its something to learn yeah it really is
Now you know what that sticky stuff is
I'll be there with you baby through the thin and the thick
I'm gonna clean up all the poo and the sick
I'll be there to make you happy and keep everything clean
I'll change the nappies through the washing machine
'Cause I ain't no baddy, I ain't no baddy
I ain't no baddy, I am your baby's daddy
Oh!
Who!
Sometimes you think what a fool I am
Why did I marry this soulful man
Now a baby's part of my family plan
Can it kick me well yes it can
My name's Ken and I've got fleas
Do you like being a daddy?
Yeah, defiantly
Well I have to warn you although its fun
There are times when you wish you had been a nun
I'll be there with you baby through the thin and the thick
I'm gonna clean up all the poo and the sick
I'll be there to make you happy and I'll bring in the bread
I'll be the nanny you can go out instead
I know that you'll be grumpy, that's what everyone says
And you're not going to hump me for 43 days
If you don't want more babies and you cannot disguise it
Then I'll take my cock and vasectimize it
'Cause I ain't no baddy, I ain't no baddy
Sometimes I make you saddy
I ain't no baddy
I ain't no baddy I ain't no baddy I am your baby's daddy
Mother!
Mother!
I ain't no baddy I ain't no baddy
I ain't no baddy I am you're baby's daddy

More a night you make me wait here for you so
Without knowing
At what time will come
Turn the TV you try to distract me
But you do not come and I again stress
On your cellphone
You do not meet
Is not the end
Has passed the time you arrive
You turn your friends
I try to find you
But they tell me that you will not see
I need a tranquilizer or I will go mad
If you went would fall asleep
The night is gone already, Dawn
Where you at?
The ticking of the clock
Seems to have stopped
He did not know you expect
But I'm still here
Back home, come love me
I hope that you
I only get to sleep
When you arrive and make love to me
Has passed the time you arrive

Trouble in town
Because they cut my brother down
Because my sister can't wear her crown
There's trouble, there's trouble in town
Blood on the beat (oh-oh)
Oh my goodness, there's blood on the beat
Lore of the jungle or the law of the street
There's blood on, there's blood on the beat
And I get no shelter
And I get no peace
And I never get relief
Trouble in town (oh-oh)
Because they hung my brother Brown
Because their system just keep you down
There's trouble, there's trouble in town
And I get no shelter
And I get no peace
And I just get more police, eh
And I get no comfort
And I get no name
Everything is gettin' strained
Best friends
What's that? What's his name?
X (standby, sir)
Alright, is that X your middle name?
Of course, it's on a vehicle ID, right?
(There must be some way)
You gettin' smart? 'Cause you'll be in a fucking car with him
I'm telling you
Fucking smartass
(Or it's going to kick off some day)
I'm asking you what the X is, is that your middle name?
Of course, what is it?
Don't come back with the: What is it? Fucking shit
(There must be some way)
Talk to these fucking pigs on the street that way, you ain't talking to me that way
I don't talk to nobody in the streets, I don't hang with nobody
Well then don't come to fucking Philadelphia, stay in Jersey
I have family out here
Everybody thinks they're a fucking lawyer and they don't know jackshit
Are you supposed to grab me like this?
Grab you up? I'll grab you any way I got to
You're not protecting me while I'm trying, while I'm trying to go to work
Why don't you shut up?

There is a place
It has a face
And he was walking out the door
His mother said
She was ashamed
Cause he had no place to go
He was afraid
And I was fine
He wanted a peace of mind
Three times turn
And you go
And you go
You are free
You are free
It's a long way home
What have we done
Was it wrong
Was it wrong
Was it me, can't you see
It's a long way home
There is a snake
He will awake
And he will get you off the floor
You'll start to shake
Your friends will sweat
You are high, you will forget
She is afraid
Cause you are dying
But you have got your peace of mind
Three times turn
And you go
And you go
You are free
You are free
It's a long way home
What have we done
Was it wrong
Was it wrong
Was it me, can't you see
It's a long way home
And I won't make your dreams come true
It's on you
Got to change your lonely ways
To make it through
You found a place in outerspace
And you don't hurt anymore
Your lovely hand has slipped away
And there is nothing left to say
And we were born
Of yellow sand
There is no plan
There is no end
Three times turn
And you go
And you go
You are free
You are free
It's a long way home
All night long
I was wrong
I was wrong
It was me, can't you see
It's a long way home
It took a million lives to see her smile
Don't touch, it's too much
To make it and she'll send you home
Afraid of love, afraid you might get hurt
Good luck, don't get stuck
Turn right before you can't go back

Wise men say
It looks like rain today
It crackled on the speakers
And trickled down the sleepy subway trains
For heavy eyes could hardly hold us
Aching legs that often told us
It's all worth it
We all fall in love sometimes
The full Moon's bright
And starlight filled the evening
We wrote it and I played it
Something happened
It's so strange this feeling
Naive notions that were childish
Simple tunes that tried to hide it
But when it comes
We all fall in love sometimes
Did we, didn't we, should we, couldn't we
I'm not sure 'cause sometimes we're so blind
Struggling through the day
When even your best friend says
Don't you find
We all fall in love sometimes?
Wise men say
It looks like rain today
It crackled on the speakers
And trickled down the sleepy subway trains
For heavy eyes could hardly hold us
Aching legs that often told us

We all fall in sometimes
We all fall in sometimes
We all fall in sometimes

Yellow diamonds in the light
And we're standing side by side
As your shadow crosses mine
What it takes to feel alive
It's the way I'm feeling I just can't describe
It's the way I'm feeling now
Shine a light through an open door
Love and life I will divide
Turn away cause I need you more
Feel your heartbeat next to mine
It's the way I'm feeling I just can't describe
It's the way I'm feeling now
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
Yellow diamonds in the light
And we're standing side by side

The colours of the rainbow, so pretty in the sky
Are also on the faces of people going by
I see friends shakin' hands, sayin'
How do you do?
They're really saying
I love you
I hear babies cryin', I watch them grow
They'll learn much more than I'll ever know

I slipped away last night
Took me away from sight and the place I know
All crushed upon my skin
This mess I put you in and the punch I threw
It was a strange reaction
For someone like you to remain on side
And in a chain reaction
I was down and calling for a place to hide
I saw a broken arm
Machines will all break down in the way I know
Mended and all made clean
I saw up on the screen all the stones I throw
It was a strange reaction
For someone like you to remain so sure
And in a chain reaction
I dissolve and break and then away I crawl

Those doors flew back

Ah caught you smiling at me
That's the way it should be
Like a leaf is to a tree, so fine
Ah all the good times we had
I sang love songs so glad
Always smiling, never sad, so fine
As we walk down the country lanes
I'll be singing a song
Hear me calling your name
Hear the wind within the trees
Telling mother nature about you and me
Well if the sun shines so bright
Or on our way it's darkest night
The road we choose is always right, so fine
Ah can your love be so strong
When so many loves go wrong
Will our love go on and on
My, my, la de la, come on now it ain't too far
Tell your friends all around the world
Ain't no companion like a blue eyed merle
Come on now well let me tell you
What you're missing, missing, around them brick walls
So of one thing I am sure, it's a friendship so pure
Angels singing all around my door, so fine
Yeah, ain't but one thing to do spend my natural life with you
You're the finest dog I knew, so fine
When you're old and your eyes are dim
There ain't no old shep gonna happen again
We'll still go walking down country lanes
I'll sing the same old songs, hear me call your name

There's a man with a gun over there
A telling me I've got to beware
I think it's time we stop
Children, what's that sound?
Everybody look what's going down
There's battle lines being drawn
Nobody's right if everybody's wrong
Young people speaking their minds
A gettin' so much resistance from behind
I think it's time we stop
Hey, what's that sound?
Everybody look what's going down
What a field day for the heat
A thousand people in the street
Singin' songs and a carrying signs
Mostly sayin' hooray for our side
It's time we stop
Hey, what's that sound?
Everybody look what's going down
Paranoia strikes deep
Into your life it will creep
It starts when you're always afraid
Step out of line, the men come and take you away
You better stop

I just got your letter baby
Too bad you can't come home
I swear i'm goin' crazy
Sittin' here all alone
Since your gone
I got a mess of blues
I ain't slept a week since sunday
I can't eat a thing all day
Every day is just blue monday
Since you've been away
Since your gone
I got a mess of blues
Whoops there goes a teardrop
Rollin' down my face
If you cry when you're in love
It sure ain't no disgrace
Whoops there goes a teardrop
Rollin' down my face
If you cry when you're in love
It sure ain't no disgrace
I gotta get myself together
Before i lose my mind
I'm gonna catch the next train goin'
And leave my blues behind
Since your gone
I got a mess of blues
I got a mess of blues

Train I ride 16 coaches long

Well that big black train
Took my baby along

Well he took my baby

I got on a city bus and found a vacant seat
I thought I saw my future bride walking up the street
I shouted to the driver hey conductor, you must slow down
I think I see her please let me off this bus
Nadine, honey is that you?
Oh Nadine, honey, is that you?
Seems like every time I see you darling
You got something else to do
Seems like every time I catch you
Datcha you're up to something new
I saw her from the corner when she turned and doubled back
And started walking toward a coffee colored cadillac
I was pushing through the crowd to get to where she's at
And I was campaign shouting like a southern diplomat
Downtown searching for her, looking all around
Saw her getting in a yellow cab heading up town
I caught a loaded taxi, paid up everybody's tab
With a twenty dollar bill, told him 'catch that yellow cab
She move around like a wave of summer breeze
Go, driver, go, go, catch her balmy breeze
Moving thru the traffic like a mounted cavalier
Leaning out the taxi window trying to make her hear

We was reelin' and a-rockin' and rollin' till the break of dawn

It's been a long time since I rock and roll
It's been a long time since I did the stroll
Let me get it back, let me get it back
Let me get it back, baby, where I came from?
It's been a long time, been a long time
Been a long lonely
Lonely, lonely, lonely
Lonely time
Yes, it has
It's been a long time since the book of love
I can't count the tears of a life with no love
Carry me back, carry me back
Carry me back, baby, where I came from
It's been a long time, been a long time
Been a long lonely
Lonely, lonely, lonely
Lonely time
Seems so long since we walked in the moonlight
Making vows that just can't work right
Open your arms, open your arms
Open your arms, baby, let my love come running in
It's been a long time, been a long time
Been a long lonely
Lonely, lonely, lonely
Lonely time

Up in the morning and out to school
The teacher is teaching the golden role
American history and pracitcal math
You study them hard, hoping to pass
Working your fingers right down to the bone
The guy behind you won't leave you alone
Ring, ring, goes the bell
The cook in the lunchroom is ready to sell
You're lucky if you can find a seat
You're fortunate if you have time to eat
Back in the classroom open your books
Keep it the teacher don't know how mean she looks
Soon as 3 o'clock rolls around
You finally lay your burdon down
Close up your books get out of your seat
Down the halls and in to the street
Up to the corner and round the bend
Right to the juke joint you go in
Drop the coin right in to the slot
You gotta hear something that's really hot
With the one you love you're making romance
All day long you been wanting to dance
Feeling the music from head to toe
Round and round, and round you go
Drop the coin right in
Hail! Hail! Rock 'n' roll
Deliver me from the days of old
Long live rock 'n' roll
The feeling of drums loud and bold
Rock! Rock! Rock 'n' roll
The feeling is there body and soul

Oh, look over there

Here comes that girl again
One that I know since I don't know when
But she don't notice me, when I pass
She goes with all the guys who are out of my class
But that can't stop me from thinkin' to myself
She's sure fine lookin' man, she's something else.
Hey, look over there
Across the street
There's a car just right for me
Took on a quality of luxery
But right now I can't afford the gas
I guessthe cars right out of my class
But that can't stop me from thinkin' to myself
That cars fine lookin' man, it something else.
Hey, look-a here
Just wait and see
I'm gonna work hard and save my dough
Gonna buy the car
Get me that girl and go ridin' around
We'll go to the shop a right block down
I'll keep on right on dreamin' and thinkin' to myself
If it all comes true man, wow, that's something else.
Look a-here
What's all this
Never thought I'd do this before
But here I am a-knockin' on a door
My cars out front
And it's all mine
Justa 41 ford not a 59
I've got that girl and I'm a thinkin' to myself
She's sure fine lookin' man, wow, she's something else.

Oh, it sounds so good, oh so good

Oh, know I feel's so strange looking at the door
Oh, trying hard to change and can't let go
Oh, crying tears of pain hurting more and more
Oh, every day's the same as you walk the floor
I'm walking the floor over you
I'm walking the floor
Every heart that breaks is a heart that's cold
Oh, to the hand that takes your dreamless soul
Oh, is it long to wait, is there much to pay?
Oh, sometimes it's hard waiting the day
You know, it's hard
I said it's hard, you know, it's true
I said it's hard, you know, it's hard
Still know it's true
Every tear that falls is a smile that's lost
When you hear the call, can you count the cost?
And you stand alone, do you wonder how?
Can you step aside, does it matter now?
Every love that's changed spend it fully
In the eyes of the night was it hard to see?
If it never fails in spite of it all
So you hide in the tears, enter Walter's walk
Know it's true now
You know, it's true now, oh yeah
I'm walking the floor over you
I'm walking the floor
Every tear that falls is a smile that's lost
When you hear the call, can you count the cost?
As you stand alone, do you wonder how?
Can you step aside, does it matter now?
Does it matter now, does it?
Now does it matter?
Now does it matter?
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Oh little baby, don't you know?
Every tear that falls
Does it matter now?
Does it matter now?
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Oh yes, oh yes
