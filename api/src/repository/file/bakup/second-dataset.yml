I said the joint was rocking
Goin' round and round
Yeah, reeling and a rocking
What a crazy sound
And they never stopped rocking
'til the moon went down
Well it sounds so sweet
I had to take me chance
Rose out of my seat
I just had to dance
Started moving my feet
Whoa to clapping my hands
I said the joint was a rocking
Goin' round and round
Yeah, reeling and a rocking
What a crazy sound
And they never stopped rocking
'til the moon went down
Yeah at twelve o'clock
Yeah the place was packed
Front doors was locked
Yeah the place was packed
And when the police knocked
Those doors flew back
But they kept on rocking
Goin' round and round
Yeah, reeling and a rocking
What a crazy sound
And they never stopped rocking
'til the moon went down
And they go on rocking
Goin' round and round
Yeah, reeling and a rocking
What a crazy sound
And they never stopped rocking
'til the moon went down
Well the joint stayed a rocking
Goin' round and round
Yeah, reeling and a rocking
What a crazy sound
And they never stopped rocking
'til the moon went down

I found my thrill on blueberry hill
On blueberry hill when i found you
The moon stood still on blueberry hill
And lingered until my dreams came true
The wind in the willow played
Love's sweet melody
But all of those vows we made
Were never to be
Tho' we're apart, you're part of me still
For you were my thrill on blueberry hill

Ah caught you smiling at me
That's the way it should be
Like a leaf is to a tree, so fine
Ah all the good times we had
I sang love songs so glad
Always smiling, never sad, so fine
As we walk down the country lanes
I'll be singing a song
Hear me calling your name
Hear the wind within the trees
Telling mother nature about you and me
Well if the sun shines so bright
Or on our way it's darkest night
The road we choose is always right, so fine
Ah can your love be so strong
When so many loves go wrong
Will our love go on and on
My, my, la de la, come on now it ain't too far
Tell your friends all around the world
Ain't no companion like a blue eyed merle
Come on now well let me tell you
What you're missing, missing, around them brick walls
So of one thing I am sure, it's a friendship so pure
Angels singing all around my door, so fine
Yeah, ain't but one thing to do spend my natural life with you
You're the finest dog I knew, so fine
When you're old and your eyes are dim
There ain't no old shep gonna happen again
We'll still go walking down country lanes
I'll sing the same old songs, hear me call your name

There's something happening here
What it is ain't exactly clear
There's a man with a gun over there
A telling me I've got to beware
I think it's time we stop
Children, what's that sound?
Everybody look what's going down
There's battle lines being drawn
Nobody's right if everybody's wrong
Young people speaking their minds
A gettin' so much resistance from behind
I think it's time we stop
Hey, what's that sound?
Everybody look what's going down
What a field day for the heat
A thousand people in the street
Singin' songs and a carrying signs
Mostly sayin' hooray for our side
It's time we stop
Hey, what's that sound?
Everybody look what's going down
Paranoia strikes deep
Into your life it will creep
It starts when you're always afraid
Step out of line, the men come and take you away
You better stop
Hey, what's that sound?
Everybody look what's going
You better stop
Hey, what's that sound?
Everybody look what's going
You better stop
Now, what's that sound?
Everybody look what's going
You better stop
Children, what's that sound?
Everybody look what's going

Sittin' here all alone

I can't eat a thing all day
Every day is just blue monday
Since you've been away
Since your gone
I got a mess of blues
Whoops there goes a teardrop
Rollin' down my face
If you cry when you're in love
It sure ain't no disgrace
Whoops there goes a teardrop
Rollin' down my face
If you cry when you're in love
It sure ain't no disgrace

Before i lose my mind
I'm gonna catch the next train goin'
And leave my blues behind
Since your gone

I got on a city bus and found a vacant seat
I thought I saw my future bride walking up the street
I shouted to the driver hey conductor, you must slow down
I think I see her please let me off this bus
Nadine, honey is that you?
Oh Nadine, honey, is that you?
Seems like every time I see you darling
You got something else to do
Seems like every time I catch you
Datcha you're up to something new
I saw her from the corner when she turned and doubled back
And started walking toward a coffee colored cadillac
I was pushing through the crowd to get to where she's at
And I was campaign shouting like a southern diplomat
Downtown searching for her, looking all around
Saw her getting in a yellow cab heading up town
I caught a loaded taxi, paid up everybody's tab
With a twenty dollar bill, told him 'catch that yellow cab
She move around like a wave of summer breeze
Go, driver, go, go, catch her balmy breeze
Moving thru the traffic like a mounted cavalier
Leaning out the taxi window trying to make her hear

Let me get it back, let me get it back

Lonely, lonely, lonely
Lonely time
Seems so long since we walked in the moonlight
Making vows that just can't work right
Open your arms, open your arms
Open your arms, baby, let my love come running in
It's been a long time, been a long time
Been a long lonely
Lonely, lonely, lonely
Lonely time

Up in the morning and out to school
The teacher is teaching the golden role
American history and pracitcal math
You study them hard, hoping to pass
Working your fingers right down to the bone
The guy behind you won't leave you alone
Ring, ring, goes the bell
The cook in the lunchroom is ready to sell
You're lucky if you can find a seat
You're fortunate if you have time to eat
Back in the classroom open your books
Keep it the teacher don't know how mean she looks
Soon as 3 o'clock rolls around
You finally lay your burdon down
Close up your books get out of your seat
Down the halls and in to the street
Up to the corner and round the bend
Right to the juke joint you go in
Drop the coin right in to the slot
You gotta hear something that's really hot
With the one you love you're making romance
All day long you been wanting to dance
Feeling the music from head to toe
Round and round, and round you go
Drop the coin right in
Hail! Hail! Rock 'n' roll
Deliver me from the days of old
Long live rock 'n' roll
The feeling of drums loud and bold
Rock! Rock! Rock 'n' roll
The feeling is there body and soul

Oh, look over there
Here she comes
Here comes that girl again
One that I know since I don't know when
But she don't notice me, when I pass
She goes with all the guys who are out of my class
But that can't stop me from thinkin' to myself
She's sure fine lookin' man, she's something else.
Hey, look over there
Across the street
There's a car just right for me
Took on a quality of luxery
But right now I can't afford the gas
I guessthe cars right out of my class
But that can't stop me from thinkin' to myself
That cars fine lookin' man, it something else.
Hey, look-a here
Just wait and see
I'm gonna work hard and save my dough
Gonna buy the car
Get me that girl and go ridin' around
We'll go to the shop a right block down
I'll keep on right on dreamin' and thinkin' to myself
If it all comes true man, wow, that's something else.
Look a-here
What's all this
Never thought I'd do this before
But here I am a-knockin' on a door
My cars out front
And it's all mine
Justa 41 ford not a 59
I've got that girl and I'm a thinkin' to myself
She's sure fine lookin' man, wow, she's something else.

Oh, you walk it good, yes you walk it good
Baby, when you talk that sweet talk
Oh, it sounds so good, oh so good
With a little bit of concentration

And when the rhythm takes me
It feels so good, oh so goodv Baby if it keeps a-shaking

Oh, know I feel's so strange looking at the door
Oh, trying hard to change and can't let go
Oh, crying tears of pain hurting more and more
Oh, every day's the same as you walk the floor
I'm walking the floor over you
I'm walking the floor
Every heart that breaks is a heart that's cold
Oh, to the hand that takes your dreamless soul
Oh, is it long to wait, is there much to pay?
Oh, sometimes it's hard waiting the day
You know, it's hard
I said it's hard, you know, it's true
I said it's hard, you know, it's hard
Still know it's true
Every tear that falls is a smile that's lost
When you hear the call, can you count the cost?
And you stand alone, do you wonder how?
Can you step aside, does it matter now?
Every love that's changed spend it fully
In the eyes of the night was it hard to see?
If it never fails in spite of it all
So you hide in the tears, enter Walter's walk
Know it's true now
You know, it's true now, oh yeah
I'm walking the floor over you
I'm walking the floor
Every tear that falls is a smile that's lost
When you hear the call, can you count the cost?
As you stand alone, do you wonder how?
Can you step aside, does it matter now?
Does it matter now, does it?
Now does it matter?
Now does it matter?
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Oh little baby, don't you know?

Does it matter now?

Esta aqui é p'ra malta da pesada
Que sofre com o SLB a valer
Não há como uma boa Rockalhada
Pa por o nosso glorioso a mexer
O Estádio da Luz já está ao rubro
Oitenta mil goelas a cantar
E no meio disto tudo é que eu descubro
Que o Benfica já está a golear
Benfica vai p'rá frente com genica
Até ganharmos tudo que há pra ganhar
Vamos cantar o rock do Benfica
Pa por o estádio da luz a vibrar
Quero ver as bandeiras no ar
E as caras pintadas de encarnado
A onda está ai, está a chegar
Já estou a ver o pessoal levantado
As claques não deixam de gritar
SLB até à exaustão
Há só uma coisa que as pode parar
É a outra equipa pedir a rendição
Benfica vai p'rá frente com genica
Até ganharmos tudo que há pra ganhar
Vamos cantar o rock do Benfica
Pa por o estádio da luz a vibrar

Back in black
I hit the sack
I've been too long I'm glad to be back
Yes, I'm let loose
From the noose
That's kept me hanging about
I've been looking at the sky
'Cause it's gettin' me high
Forget the hearse 'cause I never die
I got nine lives
Cat's eyes
Abusin' every one of them and running wild
'Cause I'm back
Yes, I'm back
Well, I'm back
Yes, I'm back
Well, I'm back, back
Well, I'm back in black
Yes, I'm back in black
Back in the back
Of a Cadillac
Number one with a bullet, I'm a power pack
Yes, I'm in a bang
With a gang
They've got to catch me if they want me to hang
'Cause I'm back on the track
And I'm beatin' the flack
Nobody's gonna get me on another rap
So look at me now
I'm just makin' my play
Don't try to push your luck, just get out of my way
'Cause I'm back
Yes, I'm back
Well, I'm back
Yes, I'm back
Well, I'm back, back
Well, I'm back in black
Yes, I'm back in black
Well, I'm back, yes I'm back

I would cut my legs and tits off
When I think of Boris Karloff and Kinski
In the dark of the moon
It made me dream of Nosferatu
Trapped on the isle of Doctor Moreau
Oh wouldn't it be lovely
I was thinking Peter Lorre
When things got pretty gory as I
Crossed to the Brandenburg Gate
I was feeling snappy perhaps I'd been napping
And I'd just ate
A following heart can tear you apart
On a midnight to 8 shift
A graveyard romance can only give one chance
As the tombstones weave and breathe
Feeling happy when my heart got beating
On a Sunday afternoon
I dreamt of breezes going through the treeses
And stars were still illumed
I have three hearts that I keep apart
Trying to relate
To normal feelings and the nightime reelings
And some absynthe drunk so late
The cook got drunk and all the whores they shrunk
Onto the size of dessert plates
But me I'm happy cause I got my little nappy
And some opium to set me straight
I'm just a small town girl who wants to give it a whirl
While my looks still hold me straight
Straight up to illusion and fantasy's fusion
Of reality mixed with drink
I'm just a small town girl who's gonna give life a whirl
Looking at the Brandenburg Gate

There I was completely wasting
Out of work and down
All inside it's so frustrating
As I drift from town to town
Feel as though nobody cares
If I live or die
So I might as well begin
To put some action in my life
Breaking the law, breaking the law
So much for the golden future
I can't even start
I've had every promise broken
And there's anger in my heart
You don't know what it's like
You don't have a clue
If you did you'd find yourselves
Doing the same thing too
Breaking the law, breaking the law
You don't know what it's like

Born to push you around
You better just stay down
You pull away
He hits the flesh
You hit the ground
Mouth so full of lies
Tend to black your eyes
Just keep them closed
Keep praying
Just keep waiting
Waiting for the one
The day that never comes
When you stand up and feel the warmth
But the son shine never comes
No, the son shine never comes
Push you cross that line
Just stay down this time
Hide in yourself
Crawl in yourself
You'll have your time
God I'll make them pay
Take it back one day
I'll end this day
I'll splatter color on this gray
Waiting for the one
The day that never comes
When you stand up and feel the warmth
But the son shine never comes, no
Love is a four letter word
And never spoken here
Love is a four letter word
In this prison
Love is a four letter word
And never spoken here
Love is a four letter word
Here in this prison
And I will wait no longer
I put an end to this
This I swear
This I swear
The son will shine
This I swear
This I swear
This son will shine

Why do you cheat on me
Why do I cheat on thee
Why do I cheat on me
Why do I cheat on me
I have a passionate heart
It can tear us apart
I have the loves of many men
But I don't love any of them
Why do I cheat on me
You have your feelings
I have mine
I spit upon you and change my mind
I have many hearts to break
And many, many, many more to take
Let the light of stars pour out
Like a candle in a spout
Let the wick recede and break
Let the starlight radiate
Why do you cheat on me
Why do I cheat on me
Why do I cheat on thee
Why do I desecrate me
Why do I piss my dreams
That's because that's what it is
I have the drive
I got the scope
If I, if I, if I, could I give you a rope
Your love means zero to me
I'm a passionateless wave upon the sea
Passionateless wave upon the sea
Why, why, why
Do you cheat on me
Why, why, why
Do I cheat on thee
Oh why, do I cheat on me
Why do I cheat on myself
Well I got nobody else
I'm only young once
I want to taste it all and have fun
I have no real feelings in my soul
Where most have passion I got a hole
I really got nobody else
I want lovers like the rain
So many of them, so much the same
You say you love me, I know it's true
But I, I, I don't love you
Why do I cheat on me
Why do you cheat on me
Your love means zero to me
A passionateless wave
Your love means zero to me

Liberty or death, what we so proudly hail
Once you provoke her, rattling of her tail
Never begins it, never, but once engaged
Never surrenders, showing the fangs of rage
Don't tread on me
So be it
Threaten no more
To secure peace is to prepare for war
So be it
Settle the score
Touch me again for the words that you will hear evermore
Don't tread on me
Love it or leave it, she with the deadly bite
Quick is the blue tongue, forked as the lighting strike
Shining with brightness, always on surveillance
The eyes, they never close, emblem of vigilance
Don't tread on me
So be it
Threaten no more
To secure peace is to prepare for war
So be it
Settle the score
Touch me again for the words that you will hear evermore

I'm for law and order, the way that it should be.
This song's about the night they spent protecting you from me.
Someone called this outlaw, in some ol' magazine.
New York sent a posse down like I ain't never seen.
Don't you think this outlaw bit has done got out of hand?
What started out to be a joke, the law don't understand.
Was it singing through my nose that got me busted by the man?
Maybe this here outlaw bit has done got out of hand.
We were wrapped up in our music, that's why we never saw,
The cars pull up, the boys get out and the room fill up with law.
They came pounding through the back door in the middle of the song.
They got me for possession of something that was gone, long gone.
Don't you think this outlaw bit has done got out of hand?
What started out to be a joke, the law don't understand.
Was it singing through my nose that got me busted by the man?
Maybe this here outlaw bit has done got out of hand.
Don't you think this outlaw bit has done got out of hand, out of hand?

You don't actually care
Love for you is no beginning
You're not really there
Hallucination
I thought you were listening
Hallucination
I thought you were listening
Hallucination
I understand you think you're above it
The adolescent sense of the sky
The feeling of billowing heartbeats
The fingertips run through your hair
They run through your hair
Hallucination
Hallucination
Oh you think you're so special
That there's no law meant for you
You come and go like the goddess you are
We're mere mortals below
Fingertips run through your hair
We are mere mortals below
Are meant to be peons
Are meant to be servants
Are meant to be dismissible objects
One fucks with
One fucks with
Poor pitiful creature
The winner in heartbreak
The winner in caring
The winner in every miniscule method of wearing
Your heart on your sleeve
A red star of idiocy
An idiot's idiocy
My, my caring for you
Caring for you
Do you think we're a book
Some kind of a table
You can rest your feet on when you're able
Red star of idiocy
An idiot's idiocy
My caring for you
Poor pitiful creature
To notice the pining
The self deprivation
The self flagellation of you
Dear worshippers
We do like you regal
We do like you haughty
We do love to look upon your perfect body
The hair on your shoulders
The smell of your armpit
The taste of your vulva and everything on it
We all really love you
And you have no meaning
You don't even see us
You were never caring
You go do what you do
You do it for you
No one exists with you
You're way above caring
Leave a trail upon the wake
That no one ever tries to take
Because waiting for you
Thinking of you
Is another way of dying
Is another way of dying
I'm clawing your chest
'Til your collarbone bleeds
Piercing your nipples 'til I bite them off
I scratch your face and bite your shoulders
Way above caring
Way above caring
And your Kotex jukebox
Your Kotex jukebox
I'm doomed, I'm swearing
Waiting for you
In your high heels and nightie
Your leather dress squeaking
Latex now sweating, waiting for you
In your tincture
Your opium white bathrobe
Your white tiles run red now
Are we both dead now?
The liquid exchange of our heart
The liquid exchange of our heart
Are we both dead now?
You're way above caring
Your heart on your sleeve
A red star of idiocy
An idiot's idiocy
My caring
My caring for you
My caring for you
You're way beyond caring
Your heart on your sleeve
A red star of idiocy
An idiot's idiocy
My caring for you
Oblivious to caring
Oblivious to caring
Oblivious to caring
Leave a trail upon the wake
That no one ever tries to take
Because waiting for you
Because thinking of you
Is another way of dying
You're way above caring
Oblivious to caring
Oblivious to caring
You poor pitiful creature
The mistake of feeling
The one who rejects you is the winner,
It's true
The winner in heartbreak
The winner in caring
The winner in every miniscule method of wearing
Your heart on your sleeve
A red star of idiocy
An idiot's idiocy
Your heart on your fuckin' sleeve
My caring for you
We were meant to be peons
We're meant to be peons
Mere mortals below
Meant to be servants
Meant to be dismissible objects one fucks with
Oh, oh, oh you're so special
No law meant for you
You come and go like the goddess you are
The fingertips run through your hair
A billowing heart beats
Feeling
Feeling
What a glorious feeling
To be so rejected
So rejected
An idiot's idiocy
My caring for you
You think I'm a book or a table
You can rest your fuckin' feet on
When you're able
The taste of your vulva, everything on it
The hair on your shoulders
The smell of your armpit
We do love you, to look upon your perfect body
We love you regal
We love you haughty
Oblivious to caring
Oblivious to caring
Caring
Oh my dear
Oh my dear
Oh my dear
Oblivious to caring
Are we really dead now?
Are we both dead now?

Luck (luck, luck), Runs (runs, runs), Out (out, out)
Crawling from the wreckage one more time
This map is tattered, can't free the signs
Though the body's rusted
Isn't hard to turn
On the path of destruction, feel it burn
Feel safe, in the danger
Feel good, in the bad
God! The burning, I've got the speed
Loose your turn, you crash and burn, you walk away
'Cause it ain't no good when there's nothing
Ain't no good when you can't go wrong
Crash and burn then you walk away
How many times can I hear you say
Ain't no good when there's nothing
Ain't no good when you can't go wrong, yeah
Luck, runs, out
You crawl back in, but your luck runs out
Luck (luck,luck), Runs (runs,runs), Out (out,out)
In love with my struggle
In love with my pain
Much needed to keep me down again
Don't allow myself to feel too good
Unworthy of me, couldn't if I could
Feel safe, in the danger
Feel good, in the bad
God! The burning, I've got the speed
Loose your turn, you crash and burn, you walk away
'Cause it ain't no good when there's nothing
Ain't no good when you can't go wrong
Crash and burn then you walk away
How many times can I hear you say
Ain't no good when there's nothing
Ain't no good when you can't go wrong, yeah
Luck, runs, out
You crawl back in, but your luck runs out
And you crawl back in
Deep in your obsession
Since you've crashed and burned
This is your confession
Ain't no good when there's nothing
Ain't no good when you can't go wrong
Crash and burn then you walk away
How many times can I hear you say
Ain't no good when there's nothing
Ain't no good when you can't go wrong, yeah
Luck, runs, out
You crawl back in, but your luck runs out

Frustration
In my lexicon of hate
I see you with your portraiture
Does he love you?
Does he love you too?
The brush strokes
Kiss your breasts and toes
I cry icicles in my stein
The heartbeats flutter
With an abnormal rhythm
The pain shoots through my body
A sword between my thighs
I wish that I could kill you
But I too love your eyes
You're feeling less whore but you stimulate
The hatred smolders in your eyes
I'd drop to my knees in a second
To salivate in your thighs
But all I do is fall over
I don't have the strength I once had
In you and your prickless lover
And his easel in his eyes
I feel the pain creep up my leg
Blood runs from my nose
I puke my guts out at your feet
You're more man than I
To be dead to have no feeling
To be dry and spermless like a girl
I want so much to hurt you
I want so much to hurt you
I want so much to hurt you
Marry me
I want you as my wife
Spermless like a girl
More man than I
More man than I
Frustration
In my lexicon of hate
You're feeling less like a whore but you
Stimulate
All I do is fall over
I don't have the strength I once had
All I do is fall over
I don't have the strength I once had
I want you so much to hurt you
I want so much to hurt you
I want so much to hurt you
I want you as a wife
Frustration is my lexicon of hate
Frustration is my lexicon of hate
Fru… fru… frustration, my lexicon of hate
I cry icicles
Heartbeats flutter
Abnormal rhythm
I wish that I could kill you
But I too love your eyes
I want you as my wife
I want you as my wife
Spermless like a girl
Lucky in feeling
More man than I
Marry me, marry me, marry me
I want you as a wife
Spermless like a girl
Puking my guts at your feet
More man than I
Fru… fru… fru… frustration
Frustration

Stone without soul
Or sorrow.
Empty, are they?
Death, won't you let me stay.
Empty, are they?
Death, won't you call my name.
Angelhead, I'm already dead
It's just the funeral I've been waiting for
Angelface, mother full of grace
Touch me so we'll be together, forever
And ever and evermore.
Crow the lonely crow
I think he knows
I'm lonely too
So lonely
Empty, are they?
Death, Won't you let me stay.
Empty, are they?
Death, Won't you call my name.
Angelhead, I'm already dead
It's just the funeral I've been waiting for
Angelface, mother full of grace
Touch me so we'll be together, forever
And ever and evermore.
Is that rain or are they tears
That stain the concrete face for years
The crying, weeping, shedding all
It's fall to winter
Back to fall.
An air of freshly broken ground
A concrete angel it'll down
Upon the new stone with my name
It's peace at least
Oh, peace at last.
Empty, are they?
Death, Won't you let, me, stay.
Empty, are they?
Death, Won't you call, my, name.
Angelhead, I'm already dead
It's just the funeral I've been waiting for
Angelface, mother full of grace
Touch me so we'll be together, forever
And ever, and evermore.

When the words have all been said
When you've made upon your bed
When the codes have all been cracked
When you've double backed your tracks
So what now?
Where go I?
When it seems it's all said and done
When the storm is up and gone
When the battle has been done
When the races have been run
When the songs have all been sung
So what now?
Where go I?
When it seems it's all said and done
Start the fire
Start the fire
Spark the wire
C'mon, start the fire
You drink the dirty water
You put the fire out
Your drink the dirty water
You put your fire out
When the room it hits so clean
When the scenes have all been seen
When the roads have all been cleared
When the fears are all unfeared
And what now?
Where go I?

Start the fire
Start the fire
Spark the wire
Start the fire
You drink the dirty water
You put the fire out
Your drink the dirty water
You put your fire out
On your feet or on your knees
Freedom is just one of these
Start the fire
Start the fire
Spark the wire
Start the fire
You drink the dirty water
You put the fire out
Your drink the dirty water
You put your fire out

Hate is a train
That thunders aimless through my head
And hate is the fame
Chained to the wheel until i'm dead
Rage is a flame
Creates a touch to boil the seas
And rage is to blame
Forever sorry i shall be
And from a darkness i descend
Clenching a torch of sweet revenge
You took away tomorrow, still i stand
I ride into the sorrow, still i stand
You took away tomorrow, still i stand
Straight down into the sorrow, but still i stand
Wrath is the name
Branding suffer onto you
And wrath takes the shame
And holds me down until its through
And from a darkness i descend
Clenching a torch of sweet revenge
You took away tomorrow, still i stand
I ride into the sorrow, still i stand
You took away tomorrow, still i stand
I sink into the sorrow, but still i stand
And hate is a train
They'd hung for those fleshes carved
And hate takes the blame
A beast that never slows at all
And from a darkness i descend
Clenching a torch of sweet revenge
Burst into flame, the bitter end
And shake the gates of hell again
Cursed to drown in sorrow
You took away tomorrow, still i stand
I ride into the sorrow, still i stand
You took away tomorrow, still i stand
You left me here with sorrow, still i stand

Like a siren in my head and there is no emergency,
Like a blind man that is strapped into the speeding driver's seat,
Like a face that learned to speak, when all it knew was how to bite,
Like a hurt that keeps me focused though I think I've gone astray,
Like an endless nightmare that I must awaken from each day.
Like a dream, a beautiful dream, not worthy of so I deny... I deny.
You close your eyes and try to wish it all into place,
You never open them, so it passed you by.
You close your eyes, so you may never fall from grace
You open just in time to say goodbye.
Almost like your life,
Almost like your endless fight,
Struggling along,
Balancing and runnin' wrong
Why is this so hard,
Always pull the joker card,
Almost like your fight,
And there it went,
Almost like your life.
Like a wound that keeps on bleeding to remind me not to think,
Like a spring that can't be uncovered until it's time to drink,
Like a puzzle, with missing pieces, and the box is thrown away.
Like a release from prison that you didn't know you're in,
Like a fight to live the past I prayed to leave from way back then,
Like a general without a mission until the wars will start again.
You close your eyes and try to wish it all into place,
You never opened them so it passed you by.
You close your eyes so you may never fall from grace,
You open just in time to say goodbye.
Almost like your life,
Almost like your endless fight,
Struggling along,
Balancing and runnin' wrong
Why is this so hard,
Always pull the joker card,
Almost like your fight,
And there it went,
Almost like your life.
Like a touch from hell to feel how hot that it can get if you get caught,
Like a touch from heaven and honest brise that brings you straight down to your knees
Like a touch from hell to feel how hot that it can get if you get caught,
Like a touch from heaven and honest brise that brings you straight down to your knees
Almost like your life,
Almost like your endless fight,
Struggling along,
Balancing and runnin' wrong
Why is this so hard,
Always pull the joker card,
Almost like your fight,
And there it went,
Almost like your life.
That was just your life.

Season ticket, on a one way ride
Asking nothing, leave me be
Taking everything in my stride

Ain't nothin' that I’d rather do
Going down, party time

No stop signs, speed limit
Nobody's gonna slow me down

Nobody's gonna mess me 'round

Hey mama! Look at me

You can't put a butterfly in a jar
If the effort's too high no matter who you are
You can't catch the moon, or the sun or the stars
It doesn't matter who you are
Iced honey
Now me I've tried a million tricks
To make life cold and make it stick
Not running heat that flames then out
But the proud piece of ice that always floats
Iced honey
If I can't trap a butterfly or a bee
If I can't keep my heart where I want it to be
If no matter how much soul and heart
I put to the wood
If a flaming heart is not that good
Iced honey
If you can't put a butterfly in a jar
If violence mars your final hour
If you make others feel like jam
Poured on a piece of charbroiled lamb
If it's all mixed up and you cannot shout
And your oxygen starts to run out
If your final gasp has the recipe wrong
And instead of hello you say so long
If your energy starts to leak out
And people wonder what you're all about
A heartbreaker with an unattached heart
The story of love gives them all a start
And me, I've always been this way
Not by choice, just this way
I can't put my honey pot in a jar
Or a heart or a fist of some young boy
If you can't put a butterfly in a jar
No wonder no need to wonder where you are
It might seem like hell, the River Styx
Your affection never sticks
No matter what you say, no matter what you do
A butterfly heart flies right past you
There's nothing to say, nothing to do
See if the ice will melt for you
Iced honey

I am Iron Man
Has he lost his mind?
Can he see or is he blind?
Can he walk at all,
Or if he moves will he fall?
Is he alive or dead?
Has he thoughts within his head?
Well just pass him there
Why should we even care?
He was turned to steel
In the great magnetic field
Where he traveled time
For the future of mankind
Nobody wants him
He just stares at the world
Planning his vengeance
That he will soon unfold
Now the time is here
For iron man to spread fear
Vengeance from the grave
Kills the people he once saved
Nobody wants him
They just turn their heads
Nobody helps him
Now he has his revenge
Heavy boots of lead
Fills his victims full of dread
Running as fast as they can
Iron man lives again!

Finished with my woman
'Cause she couldn't help me with my mind
People think I'm insane
Because I am frowning all the time
All day long I think of things
But nothing seems to satisfy
Think I'll lose my mind
If I don't find something to pacify
Can you help me?
Occupy my brain?
Oh, yeah
I need someone to show me
The things in life that I can't find
I can't see the things that make true happiness
I must be blind
Make a joke, and I will sigh
And you will laugh, and I will cry
Happiness I cannot feel
And love to me is so unreal
And so as you hear these words
Telling you now of my state
I tell you to enjoy life
I wish I could
But it's too late

Would you come to me
If I was half drowning
An arm above the last wave
Would you come to me
Would you pull me up
Would the effort really hurt you
Is it unfair to ask you
To help pull me up
The window broke the silence of the matches
The smoke effortlessly floating
Pull me up
Would you be my lord and savior
Pull me up by my hair
Now would you kiss me, on my lips
Burning fever burning on my forehead
The brain that once was listening now
Shoots out its tiresome message
Won't you pull me up
Scalding, my dead father
Has the motor and he's driving towards
An island of lost souls
Sunny, a monkey then to monkey
I will teach you meanness, fear and blindness
No social redeeming kindness
Or - oh, state of grace
Would you pull me up
Would you drop the mental bullet
Would you pull me by the arm up
Would you still kiss my lips
Hiccup, the dream is over
Get the coffee, turn the lights on
Say hello to junior dad
The greatest disappointment
Age withered him and changed him
Into junior dad
Psychic savagery
The greatest disappointment
The greatest disappointment
Age withered him and changed him
Into junior dad

Ride the Lightning
Guilty as charged
But damn it, ain't right
There is someone else controlling me
Death in the air
Strapped in the electric chair
This can't be happening to me
Who made you God to say
"I'll take your life from you!"
Flash before my eyes
Now it's time to die
Burning in my brain
I can feel the flames
No Remorse
No mercy for what we are doing
No thought to even what we have done
We don't need to feel the sorrow
No remorse for the helpless one
War without end
No remorse No repent
We don't care what it meant
Another day Another death
Another sorrow Another breath
No remorse No repent
We don't care what it meant
Another day Another death
Another sorrow Another breath
Hit the Lights
No life till leather
We are gonna kick some ass tonight
We got the metal madness
When our fans start screaming
It's right well all right
When we start to rock
We never want to stop again
Hit the lights
Hit the lights
Hit the lights
You know our fans are insane
We are gonna blow this place away
With volume higher
Than anything today the only way
When we start to rock
We never want to stop again
Hit the lights
Hit the lights
Hit the lights
The Four Horsemen
Time
Has taken its toll on you
The lines that crack you face
Famine
Your body it has torn through
Withered in every place
Pestilence
For what you have had to endure
And what you have put others through
Death deliverance for you for sure
There is nothing you can do
Phantom Lord
Sound is ripping through your ears
The deafening waiting for his whips
The taste of leather on you lips
Your bodies waiting for his whips
The taste of leather on you lips
Hear the cry of War
Louder than before
With this sword in hand
To control the land
Crushing metal strikes
On this frightening night
Fall onto your knees
For the Phantom Lord
Victims falling under chains
Your hear them crying death pains
The fists of terrors breaking through
Now there's nothing you can do
Hear the cry of War
Louder than before
With this sword in hand
To control the land
Crushing metal strikes
On this frightening night
Fall onto your knees
For the Phantom Lord
Fight Fire with Fire
Soon to fill our lungs the hot winds of death
The gods are laughing, so take your last breath
Fight fire with fire
Ending is near
Fight fire with fire
Bursting with fear
Fight fire with fire
Fight fire with fire
Ending is near
Fight fire with fire
Bursting with fear
Fight fire with fire

In the dead of night
A shimmerin' light
Gleam of a blade
And the devil was paid
When the axe comes down
A chilling sound
Steel hits the head
Another rabbit's dead
I'm a rabbit slayer
A guitar player
With a nasty habit
Kill the rabbit!
AhhhaahooOhhh
Be very very quiet!
I'm lookin' for rabbits
I'm a mean mistreater
A rabbit feaster
And I predict
A bloody Easter
A scurrying shadow
And the shadow was this rabbit
And the night air echoes
Kill the rabbit!
Kill the rabbit!
Kill the rabbit!
Kill the rabbit!
Kill the rabbit!
Kill the rabbit!
Kill the rabbit!
Ohhhh... And there won't be any more rabbits around

We won’t need to intimidate you
If we get a major breakthrough
So come on – let it loose
You’ve all seen this all before
So come on, get up and off of the floor
Let’s go – let it loose
Oh yeah
We’re not here to read your rights
Tonight’s the night you do what you like
Hey you there – let it loose
If it’s much too loud, well, we don’t care
Are you ready – let it loose
Going crazy
We’ve the goods to appetise
Take it all, don’t compromise
Oh, Let it loose
Forget tomorrow, we’re here today
Is it what you want, are you here to stay
What do you say – let it loose

Little dog who can't get in
Moaning at the bed side
Moaning from each limb
Little dog who can't get in
Can only cry but
Can not swim
Pony legs, little trot
Little dog has to wait a lot
The bigger dog has got his spot
And elbowed him away
Listen to him barking
Listen to him call
Little dog don't have much at all
A puny body and a tiny dick
A little dog can make you sick
If you got the money you can go to the top
The female dog don't care what you got
As long as you can raise that
Little doggie face to a cold hearted pussy
You could have a taste
A taste of what the big dog got
A taste of what the big dog got
The little dog with the one hundred dollar spot
Can run his tongue over the hot in trot
Hot in trot
Run his tongue over the hot in trot
Money can do anything
Money can do anything
Money can do anything
Tell me what you want
My small dog, he want what I got
Wants to run his tongue over my hot spot
Pathetic little dog
Pathetic little dog
The little man follows his nose
Counts his fingers and his toes
He still got those
Pathetic little dog
Pathetic little dog
Following his nose
But it needs my money to buy
I'm an up while you're a down
I am an up while you're a down
The spring and the will follow me around
While you sniff your shit in the wind
Sniff your shit in the wind
Money can do anything
Money can do anything
Tell me what it is you want
Just tell me what it is you want
I'm an up while you're a down
The spring and the will follow me around
Tell me what it is you want
Tell me what it is you want
You sniff your shit in the wind
Follow me around
Pathetic little dog
Pathetic little dog
Pathetic little dog

Sight
Pale riders into the night
Galloping harder and faster
Through your dreaming wake
Walk towards the fire innate
Frost bitten soul below zero
Excitation
Are you remembering the sound?
Recall the shaking of the ground?
Pounding, pounding
No remorse
Lords of Summer set on course
Pushing, pushing
Horsemen ride
Lords of Summer undenied
At last the thawing has begun
Come trade your darkness for the sun
Melting the chill of winter's turn
So celebrate and let your fires burn
The lords of summer have returned
Straight
Light passes through
Penetrate
It's been a long lonely winter
Illumination
Bright
Bathe in the volume and light
Reanimated by fire
Transformation
Become the nexus of the sound
Become the shaking of the ground
Pounding, pounding
No remorse
Lords of Summer set on course
Pushing, pushing
Horsemen ride
Lords of Summer undenied
At last the thawing has begun
Come trade your darkness for the sun
Melting the chill of winter's turn
So celebrate and let your fires burn
The lords of summer have returned
Whoa... pounding, pounding
No remorse
Lords of Summer set on course
Whoa... pushing, pushing
Horsemen ride
The Lords of Summer undenied, undenied
At last the thawing has begun
Come trade your darkness for the sun
Melting the chill of winter's turn
So celebrate and let your fires burn
The Lords of Summer have returned

I've been mistreated, I've been abused.
I've been struck downhearted, baby, I've been confused
'cause I know, yes, I know I've been mistreated.
Since my baby left me I've been losing my mind, you know I have.
I've been lonely, I've been cold.
I've been looking for a woman to have and hold
'cause I know, yes, I know I've been mistreated.
Since my baby left me I've been losing, I've been losing,
I've been losing my mind, baby baby babe.
I've been mistreated, I've been abused.
I've been looking for a woman, yeh, I've been confused

I'm built like you are
I have a dress and a train
Your snake cold lips
Make a harsh straight line
That echoes through my brain
You're perfect
Let me lift a glass high
Let me follow in your footsteps
Let me follow in your sigh
Let me follow in your sigh
I'm a woman who likes men
But this is something else
I've never felt such stirrings
I feel like I
Was someone else
I wish you'd tie me up and beat me
Crush me like a kick
A bleeding strap across my back
Some blood that you could kiss
Oh kiss away, oh kiss away
I wish there was a strap of blood
That you could kiss away
I wish there was a strap of blood
That you could kiss away
Tie me with a scarf and jewels
Put a bloody gag to my teeth
I beg you to degrade me
Is there waste that I could eat
I am a secret lover
I am your little girl
Please spit into my mouth
I'm forever in your swirl
You're heartless and I love that
You have no use of me
But I open the sticks, sticky legs I bear
And then insert a fist, an arm
Some lost appendage
Please open me I beg
You are my goliath
You are my goliath
And I am mistress dread
Oh I am mistress dread
Oh I am mistress dread
Open and release me
I love you in my head
Oh kiss away kiss away
Kiss away kiss away
All I ask my baby
Kiss away
All I ask my baby
Kiss away

The cerebrum has suffered massive and irreparable damage
You can never know what has happened to him
If I have not been sure of this, I would not have permitted him to live
Where am I?
Father
What happened?
I need help
What is democracy?
What is democracy?
It got something to do with young men killing each other, I believe
When it's comes my turn, will you want me to go?
For democracy, any man would give his only begotten son
It is impossible for any severed individual to experience pain
Pleasure
Memory
Dreams or thought of any kind
This young man will be as unfeeling
As unthinking as the dead
Until the day he joins them
I don't know whether I'm alive or dreaming or dead or remembering
How can you tell what's a dream and what's real
When you can't even tell when you're awake and when you're asleep
Where am I?
I can't remember anything
Can't tell if this is true or dream
Deep down inside I feel to scream
This terrible silence stops with me
Now that the war is through with me
I'm waking up, I cannot see
That there's not much left of me
Nothing is real but pain now
Hold my breath as I wish for death
Oh please God, wake me
They kept my head and chopped off everything
Oh god, please make them hear me
They won't listen, they won't hear me
They got to wake me up I'll be like this for years
Hear me
Back in the womb it's much too real
In pumps life that I must feel
But can't look forward to reveal
Look to the time when I'll live
Fed through the tube that sticks in me
Just like a wartime novelty
Tied to machines that make me be
Cut this life off from me
Hold my breath as I wish for death
Oh please God, wake me
It's like a piece of me that keeps on living
It won't always be like this, will it?
I can't live like this!
I-I can't!
Please no
I can't! I can't!
Help me, help me, help me!
Mother where are ya?
Mommy, mother, I'm having a nightmare and I can't wake up
Now the world is gone I'm just one
Oh God help me
Hold my breath as I wish for death
Oh please God, help me
Me lying here like, like some freak in a carnival show
Here is the armless
Legless
Wonder of the twentieth century
Death has a dignity of its own
Father!
I need help
I'm in terrible trouble and I need help
Don't you remember when you were little?
How and you and Bill Harper use to string a wire between the two houses
So you could telegraph to each other
You'll remember the Morse code
Darkness
Imprisoning me
All that I see
Absolute horror
I cannot live
I cannot die
Trapped in myself
Body my holding cell
It's Morse code
For what?
S.O.S
Help
Landmine
Has taken my sight
Taken my speech
Taken my hearing
Taken my arms
Taken my legs
Taken my soul
Left me with life in Hell
What's he saying?
Said kill me
Over and over again
Kill me
Oh god, please make them hear me
Don't you have any message for him Arthur?
He's the product of your profession
Not mine
Kill me
I'm asking you to kill me
Thank you
Save me please
Father
Each man faces death by himself
Alone
Good-bye father
Inside me I'm screaming nobody pays any attention
If I had arms, I could kill myself
If I had legs, I could run away
If I had a voice, I could talk and be some kind of company for myself
How do I know they'll kill me?
I could yell for help, but nobody'd help me
I just got to do some kind of, see how I can go on like this
S.O.S. help me
S.O.S. help me
Keep the home fires burning
While our hearts are yearning

(Guitar Solo And Instrumental)The seas have parted
The end has started
The sky has turned to black
A killing spree through eternity
The Devil stabs you in the back
It's midnight now you must escape somehow
Torture is his leisure
Don't try to hide he'll make you subside
As he exchanges pain for pleasure, he's the hunter you're the game
Pain for pleasure, Satan is his name!

Walking through the city, looking oh so pretty,
I've just got to find my way.
See the ladies flashing. All there legs and lashes.
I've just got to find my way.
Well you see me crawling through the bushes with it open wide.
What you seeing girl?
Can't you believe that feeling, can't you believe it,
Can't you believe your eyes?
It's the real thing girl.
Got me feeling myself and reeling around,
Got me talking but feel like walking around.
Got me feeling myself and reeling a...
Got me talking but nothing's with me...
Got me feeling myself and reeling around.

If I pump out blood in the sunshine
Oil on the wheel
That is blasted and busted away
A nail or a little piece of glass
A little piece of glass
A little piece of glass
Swarming like bees over the air
Off the pump off the thing
The blood that I'm pumping away
Like bees over the air
Off the pump
Off the thing
The blood that I'm pumping away
Off the pump
Off the thing
The blood that I'm pumping away
If I pump blood in the sunshine
And you wear a leather box with azaleas
And I pump more blood
And it seeps through my skin
Will you adore the river
The stream, the trickle
The tributary of my heart
As I pump more blood
And it seeps through my skin
Will you adore the river
The stream, the trickle
The tributary of my heart
If I'm pumping blood
Like a common state worker
If I waggle my ass like a dark prostitute
Would you think less of me
And my coagulating heart
Waggle my ass like a dark prostitute
Coagulating heart
Pumping blood
Would you top me off
Would you top me off as I deepen a curtsy
While you yell out, "mercy"
We grow apart
Would you rip and cut me
Use a knife on me
Be shocked at the boldness
The coldness of this little heart
Tied up in leather
Would you take the measure
Of the blood that I pump
In the manic confusion of love
Supreme violation
Supreme violation
"Oh, ah, ah, ah Jack I beseech you"
"Oh Jack I beseech you"
Supreme violation
Blood in the foyer
The bathroom
The tea room
The kitchen, with her knives splayed
I will swallow your sharpest cutter
Like a colored man's dick
Blood spurting from me
"Oh Jack, Jack I beseech…"
"Jack, I beseech you, I beseech…"
In the end it was an ordinary heart
"Oh Jack I beseech you"
As I scream out my pain
In the end it was an ordinary heart
In the end, in the end, in the end
It was an ordinary heart
"Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack I beseech you"
Supreme violation . . . Oh
"Jack, Jack, Jack I beseech you"
I call out your name
Blood in the foyer, the bathroom,
The tea room, the kitchen
And knives splayed
I swallow your sharpest cutter
Like a colored man's dick
Blood spurting from me
Blood spurting from me
"Oh Jack"
"Oh Jack, I beseech ya"
In the end it was an ordinary heart
In the end it was an ordinary heart
Pumping blood

Tarot Woman
I don't wanna go
Something tells me no, no, no, no
Traces in the sand
Lines that set my hand
Go, go, go
Beware of a place
A smile of a bright shining face
I'll never return, how do you know?
Tarot woman
I don't know
I don't know
I don't know
She can take you there
The entrance to the fair
Mine, mine, mine
Ride the carousel
And cast a magic spell
Fly, fly
Beware of a place
A smile of a brigh shining face
I'll never return, how do you know?
Tarot woman, well I don't know
I don't know
I don't know
I don't know
Stargazer
High noon, oh I'd sell my soul for water
Nine years worth of breakin' my back
There's no sun in the shadow of the wizard
See how he glides, he's lighter than air?
Oh I see his face!
Where is your star?
Is it far, is it far, is it far?
When do we leave?
I believe, I believe, yes, I believe
In the heat and the rain
With whips and chains
To see him fly
So many die
We build a tower of stone
With our flesh and bone
Just to see him fly
But don't know why
Now where do we go?
Kill The King
Danger, danger the Queen's about to kill
Stranger, stranger and life about to spill
Oh no move me out of harm
I need a spell and a charm
Fly like the wind
I'm no pawn, so be gone, speed on and on
Kill the king
Tear him down
Kill the king
Strike him down
Power, power it happens every day
Power, devour all along the way
Oh no, move me out of harm
I need a spell and a charm
And fly like the wind
I'm no pawn, so be gone, speed on and on
Kill the king
Strike him down
Treason, treason, the spectre looms again
Treason, reason, the realm is safe and then
Oh no, move away from harm
I need a spell and a charm
Fly like the rainbow
I'm no pawn, so be gone, speed on and on
Kill the king
Tear him down
Kill the king
Yeah, take his crown
Oh, kill the king
Go take his crown
Yeah, yeah, kill the king
Strike him down

Alright!
We are scanning the scene in the city tonight
We are looking for you to start up a fight
There is an evil feeling in our brains
But it is nothing new, you know it drives us insane
Running on our way
Hiding, you will pay
Dying, one thousand deaths
Running on our way
Hiding, you will pay
Dying, one thousand deaths
Searching, seek and destroy
Searching, seek and destroy
Searching, seek and destroy
Searching, seek and destroy
There is no escape and that is for sure
This is the end we won't take any more
Say goodbye to the world you live in
You have always been taking, but now you're giving
Running on our way
Hiding, you will pay
Dying, one thousand deaths
Running on our way
Hiding, you will pay
Dying, one thousand deaths
Searching, seek and destroy
Searching, seek and destroy
Searching, seek and destroy
Searching, seek and destroy
Our brains are on fire with the feeling to kill
And it will not go away until our dreams are fulfilled
There is only one thing on our minds
Don't try running away, 'cause you're the one we will find
Running on our way
Hiding, you will pay
Dying, one thousand deaths
Running on our way
Hiding, you will pay
Dying, one thousand deaths
Searching, seek and destroy
Searching, seek and destroy
Searching, seek and destroy
Searching, seek and destroy

Reaching out for something you've got to feel
While clutching to what you had thought was real
Kicking at a dead horse pleases you
No way of showing your gratitude
So many things you don't want to do
What is it? What have you got to lose?
What the hell
What is you think you're gonna find?
Hypocrite
Boredom sets into the boring mind
(Struggle Within) It suits you fine
(Struggle Within) Your ruin
(Struggle Within) You seal your own coffin
(Struggle Within) The struggling within
Home is not a home it becomes a hell
Turning it into your prison cell
Advantages are taken, not handed out
While you struggle inside your hell
Reaching out
Grabbing for something you've got to feel
Closing in
The pressure upon you is so real
(Struggle Within) It suits you fine
(Struggle Within) Your ruin
(Struggle Within) You seal your own coffin
(Struggle Within) The struggling within
Struggle
(Solo)
Dhow!
Reaching out for something you've got to feel
While clutching to what you had thought was real
What the hell
What is you think you're gonna find?
Hypocrite
Boredom sets into the boring mind
(Struggle Within) It suits you fine
(Struggle Within) Your ruin
(Struggle Within) You seal your own coffin

Claustrophobic
Crawl out of this skin
Heart explosive
Reach in, pull that pin
Ain't no one gonna watch the road
Intention reckless
Ain't no one gonna slow the row
Invention reckless
So I cross that line
Pushing myself, daring myself
Scaring myself in the suicide lane
Deadly pulse
Pawing at the wheel
Death Magnetic
Pulling closer still
Ain't no one gonna hold the border
Insanely reckless
Ain't no one gonna give the order
Inanely reckless
So I cross that line
Pushing myself, daring myself
Scaring myself in the suicide lane
I scare myself
Crushing metal, ripping skin
Tossing body mannequin
Splatter blood, bleeding gas
Mangle flesh, snapping spine
Dripping bloody valentine
Shatter face, spitting glass
What makes me drift a little bit closer
Dead man takes the steering wheel
What makes me know it's time to cross over
Dead man takes the steering wheel
See through the skin the bones they all rattle
I start to see the end in me
Flesh falls away the bones they all shatter
I start to see the end in me
Claustrophobic
Crawl out of this skin
Heart explosive
Reach in, pull that pin
Every moment,
Flashed before my eyes
I wake up screaming
Life is undenied
Ain't no one gonna search the record
Intensely reckless
Ain't no one gonna get the message
Inherely reckless
I cross that line
Pushing myself, daring myself
Scaring myself in the suicide lane
Pushing myself in the suicide lane
Daring myself in the suicide lane
Pushing myself in the suicide lane
Daring myself in the suicide lane

The ballad of ?brain knight?
To the tune of ?lamb crops sing along? and ?the song that never
Ends?
The militant bunkers where
I imagine i?m in my lover?s bed
We swam naked ? we frolicked young and free
Glistening wet like a froggies leg on a paraplegic?s knee
I gazed into his eyes, what do i see
Jaundice, a disease menagerie
But though he?s got ? a figure of an aging sloth
His love ? pump can deliver a malicious wrath
David hasselhoff ? dressed mean, with boots to tease
Bend over, please now punish me
David hasselhoff ? tuck me in bed tonight
Appease me with your leathery face
Conscripted to fort dik
Showering with men from 3 to 6
We sung about ? leotards, fairies and naked gladiators
I dreamt i was peter pan in a frock telling captain hook to suck
My cock
It looks like i see your prong
I thought you were a ? naã¯ve bastard in a stupid talking car
But then i saw you in a ?baywatch? and thought you were the
Sexiest man by far
Done run away, i beg of thee
Ill show you athens ? style sodomy
We played ? grecko marines with our sted ? fast dicks
We clubbed our pricks like homeless kids and lathered our self
With garlic bread
My heart and bowel belongs to you
No one roots like you ? they cum too soon
Oh how ? soldiers love being gay
Unlike prison we don?t need soap to play
David hasselhoff ? my syphilis caused you internal rot
Your old and crusty, you cant even please
Fly back to germany, how ?bout writing a pop song or two
Hey davey boy, here?s a message for you ?
Fuck ? off ? you ? cunt!!

You imagine you were at my station
And you brought your motor to me
You're a burner yeah, a real motor car
You say you want your order filled
Made me shiver when I put it in
Pumping just won't do, you know, lucky for you
Who'd ever thought you'd be better
At turning a screw than me
I do it for my life
You made my drive shaft crank
You made my pistons bulge
You made my ball bearings melt from the heat
Oh yeah yeah
We were shifting this hard when we took off
Put tonight all four on the floor
When we hit top then you know it feels so slow
You say you want your order filled
Made me shiver when I put it in
Pumping just won't do, you know, lucky for you
Who'd ever thought you'd be better

I do it for my life
You made my drive shaft crank
You made my pistons bulge
You made my ball bearings melt from the heat
Oh yeah yeah
I'm giving you my room service
And you know it's more than enough
When you spark my plug you know I'm in love
You imagine you were at my station
And you brought your motor to me
With all four on the floor I feel what's in store
Who'd ever thought you'd be better
At turning a screw than me
I do it for my life

I was caught
In the middle of a railroad track (thunder)
I looked round
And I knew there was no turning back (thunder)
My mind raced
And I thought what could I do (thunder)
And I knew
There was no help, no help from you (thunder)
Sound of the drums
Beatin' in my heart
The thunder of guns
Tore me apart
You've been thunderstruck
Went down the highway
Broke the limit, we hit the town
Went through to Texas, yeah, Texas
And we had some fun
We met some girls
Some dancers who gave a good time
Broke all the rules, played all the fools
Yeah, yeah, they, they, they blew our minds
I was shakin' at the knees
Could I come again, please?
Yeah, the ladies were too kind
You've been thunderstruck, thunderstruck

There is nowhere else i can run to,
She is wretched but she comforts me...
After everyone goes home,
She's always there for me !
And when the sun goes hellbound...
And the moon does resurrect the night !
I'll hide within her...
Not much good has come out of the light !
After everyone goes home,
And i'm left here on my own,
I will run straight to hell and back !
Straight to hell and back !
When they turn out all their lights,
And i'm left to brood at night,
Always return to hell and back !
Straight to hell and back !
Straight down, yeah !!!
A lonely light in a window
Just longing for some company !
Tragic, heartless and hateful
But there's nothing as willing as she !
And when the night has fallen
It falls hard and then it all begins !
When she starts her calling
I feel my darkness growing from within !
After everyone goes home,
And i'm left here on my own,
I will run straight to hell and back !
Straight to hell and back !
When they turn out all their lights,
And i'm left to brood at night,
Always return to hell and back !
Straight to hell and back !
Straight to hell and back !
I will run straight to hell and back !
I become two !
We become one !
Unbridled… unequaled… unholy… undone !
The path is cut deep !
The path is worn well !
I'll follow my footsteps to the warmth of hell !
The warmth of hell !
After everyone goes home,
And i'm left here on my own,
I will run straight to hell and back !
Straight to hell and back !
Straight to hell and back !
When they turn out all their lights,
And i'm left to brood at night,
Always return to hell and back !
Return to hell and back !
Straight to hell and back !
Straight to hell and back !
I will run straight to hell and back !
Straight down !

How could he know
This new dawn's light
Would change his life forever?
Set sail to sea
But pulled off course
By the light of golden treasure
Was he the one causing pain
With his careless dreaming?
Been afraid
Always afraid
Of the things he's feeling
He could just be gone
He would just sail on
He'll just sail on
How can I belong,
When I've got nowhere to go?
Shuffled streets of gold
How come it's got so cold?
How can I be lost?
When my ship was made to drift
And how can I blame you
When it's me I can't forgive?
His days drift on
Inside his fog
It's thick and suffocating
This sinking life
Outside it's hell
Inside, intoxicating
Ship's run aground
Like his life
The water's much too shallow
He goes down
Down with his ship
Sinking in the shadows
Now a castaway
They've all gone away
All gone away
How can I belong,
When I've got nowhere to go?
Shuffled streets of gold
How come it's got so cold?
How can I be lost?
When my ship was made to drift
And how can I blame you
When it's me I can't forgive?
Forgive me
Forgive me not
Forgive me
Forgive me not
Forgive me
Forgive me not
Forgive me
Forgive me
Why can't I forgive me?
Set sail to sea
But pulled off course
By the light of golden treasure
How could he know
This new dawn's light
Would change his life forever?
How can I belong,
When I've got nowhere to go?
Shuffled streets of gold
How come it's got so cold?
How can I be lost?
When my ship was made to drift
And how can I blame you
When it's me I can't forgive?

You see me now a veteran of a thousand psychic wars
Ive been living on the edge so long
Where the winds of limbo roar
And I'm young enough to look at
And far too old to see
All the scars are on the inside
I'm not sure if there's anything left of me
Don't let these shakes go on
Its time we had a break from it
Its time we had some leave
We've been living in the flames
We've been eating up our brains
Oh, please don't let theses shakes go on
You ask me why I'm weary, why I cant speak to you
You blame me for my silence
Say its time I changed and grew
But the wars still going on dear
And there's no end that I know
And I cant say if were ever...
I cant say if were ever gonna to be free
Don't let these shakes go on
Its time we had a break from it
Its time we had some leave
We've been living in the flames
We've been eating out our brains
Oh, please don't let theses shakes go on
You see me now a veteran of a thousand psychic wars
My energy's spent at last
And my armor is destroyed
I have used up all my weapons and I'm helpless and bereaved
Wounds are all I'm made of
Did I hear you say that this is victory?
Don't let these shakes go on
Its time we had a break from it
Send me to the rear
Where the tides of madness swell
And been sliding into hell
Oh, please don't let shakes go on
Don't let these shakes go on
Don't let these shakes go on

If you're leaving close the door.
I'm not expecting people anymore.
Hear me grieving, I'm lying on the floor.
Whether I'm drunk or dead I really ain't too sure.
I'm a blind man, I'm a blind man and my world is pale.
When a blind man cries, Lord, you know there ain't no sadder tale.
Had a friend once in a room,
had a good time but it ended much too soon.
In a cold month in that room
we found a reason for the things we had to do.
I'm a blind man, I'm a blind man, now my room is cold.
When a blind man cries, Lord, you know he feels it from his soul.
I'm a blind man, I'm a blind man and my world is pale.
When a blind man cries, Lord, you know there ain't no sadder tale.

She was a fast machine she kept her motor clean
She was the best damn woman that I ever seen
She had the sightless eyes telling me no lies
Knocking me out with those American thighs
Taking more than her share
Had me fighting for air
She told me to come, but I was already there
'Cause the walls start shaking
The earth was quaking
My mind was aching
And we were making it
And you shook me all night long
Yeah, you shook me all night long
Working double time on the seduction line
She's one of a kind, she's just mine, all mine
Wanted no applause it's just another course
Made a meal outta me
And come back for more
Had to cool me down to take another round
Now I'm back in the ring to take another swing
'Cause the walls were shaking the earth was quaking
My mind was aching
And we were making it
And you shook me all night long
Yeah, you shook me all night long
It knocked me out I said you
Shook me all night long
You had me shaking and you
Shook me all night long
Yeah, you shook me
When you took me
You really took me and you
Shook me all night long

It ain't no fun lying down to sleep
And there ain't no secrets left for me to keep
I wish the stars up in the sky would all just call in sick
And the clouds would take the moon out on some one-way trip
I drove all night down streets that wouldn't bend
But somehow they drove me back here once again
To the place I lost at love, and the place I lost my soul
I wish I'd just burn down this place that we called home
It would all have been so easy
If you'd only made me cry
And told me how you're leaving me
To some organ grinder's lullaby
It's hard, so hard - It's tearing out my heart
It's hard letting you go
Now the sky, it shines a different kind of blue
And the neighbor's dog don't bark like he used to
Well, me, these days
I just miss you - It's the nights that I go insane
Unless you're coming back
For me, that's one thing I know that won't change
It's hard, so hard - It's tearing out my heart
It's hard letting you go
Now sone tarot card shark said I'll draw you a heart
And we'll find you somebody else new
But I've made my last trip to those carnival lips
When I bet all that I had on you
It's hard, it's hard, it's hard, so hard
It's hard letting you go
It's hard, so hard - It's tearing out my heart
But it's hard letting you go

It's been a hard day's night
And I've been working like a dog
It's been a hard day's night
I should be sleeping like a log
But when I get home to you
I find the things that you do
Will make me feel alright
You know I work all day
To get you money to buy you things
And it's worth it just to hear you say
You're gonna give me everything
So why on earth should I moan
'Cos when I get you alone
You know I feel okay
When I'm home everything seems to be right
When I'm home feeling you holding me
Tight, tight, yeah
It's been a hard day's night
And I've been working like a dog
It's been a hard day's night
I should be sleeping like a log
But when I get home to you
I find the things that you do
Will make me feel alright
You know I work all day
To get you money to buy you things
And it's worth it just to hear you say
You're gonna give me everything
So why on earth should I moan
'Cos when I get you alone
You know I feel alright
When I'm home everything seems to be right
When I'm home feeling you holding me
Tight, tight, yeah
It's been a hard day's night
And I've been working like a dog
It's been a hard day's night
I should be sleeping like a log
But when I get home to you
I find the things that you do
Will make me feel alright

He freed lotta people but it seems the good they die young

Ain't no cure for love
Ain't no cure for love
There ain't no cure for love
Ain't no cure
Cupid was a blind man
He must have missed his mark
Shot an arrow in the air and hit me in the heart
I went to see Saint Valentine
Said: What's come over me
Daddy must have missed the chapter about the birds and bees
You can be the King of diamonds
You can cash in all your gold
You could hire Johnnie Cochran
It's too late to save your soul
Don't need no shot, no ambulance
Don't need prescription drugs
There ain't no cure for love
They can find the cure for the common cold
When the pushing comes to shove
There ain't no cure for love
Now someone call my lawyer
I'm going to see my shrink
I found myself in the jewelry store buying a diamond ring
I went to see my doctor
Said: Won't you help me please?
He said: Son I'm sorry, it's a terminal disease
Can't get no love insurance
Cupid draws his bow
I ain't waving boys, I'm drowning
It's a damn good way to go
Don't need no shot, no ambulance
Don't need prescription drugs
There ain't no cure for love
They can find the cure for the common cold
When the pushing comes to shove
There ain't no cure for love
You can be the King of Diamonds
You can cash in all your gold
You can hire Johnnie Cochran
It's too late to save your soul
Don't need no shot, no ambulance
Don't need prescription drugs
There ain't no cure for love
They can find the cure for the common cold
When the pushing comes to shove
There ain't no cure for love
No aspirin
No ambulance
Or Voodoo you can think up
Ain't no cure for love
Ain't no cure for love
Ain't no cure for love
Ain't no cure for love
There ain't no cure for love
Ain't no cure for love
Ain't no cure for love

Feel me like I feel you
Won't you let me come inside
Heal me like I heal you
Let your mind, body, soul, come alive
On my knees (but I'm rising)
On my feet (getting higher)
I will fly
Hey, hey, I'm alive
It's a brand new day
And I feel fine
Here to say I'm alive (didn't think I'd make it)
Hey, hey, I'm alive
Didn't think I'd make it to the other side
Here to stay I'm alive
Want me like I want you
That's my heart you hold in your hands
Touch me like I touch you
Make me feel like superman
On my knees (but I'm rising)
On my feet (getting higher)
I will fly
Hey, hey, I'm alive
It's a brand new day
And I feel fine
Here to say I'm alive (didn't think I'd make it)
Hey, hey, I'm alive
Didn't think I'd make it to the other side
Here to stay I'm alive
Like the wind run with me
Take my hand come with me
Those bastards ain't bringing us down
For all the dreams that died
And all of the tears we cried
One thing I've learned life is now
On my knees (but I'm rising)
On my feet (getting higher)
I will fly
Hey, hey, I'm alive
It's a brand new day
And I feel fine
Here to say I'm alive (didn't think I'd make it)
Hey, hey, I'm alive
Didn't think I'd make it to the other side
Here to stay I'm alive
Hey, hey, I'm alive

All I wanna do is you
Working hard eight days a week
Most days we got no time to speak
I feel like I'm chasing after my own life
Girl can't you see you're my only voice
Take the phone off the hook
Turn the lights down low
We'll play some old Sam Cooke
Baby, let yourself go
All I wanna do is you
All I wanna do is you
I'll do anything you want me to
All I wanna do is you
I don't care what kinda clothes you wear
It doesn't matter how you do your hear
I don't need no champagne on ice
Girl, can't you see that you're my only voice
Turn the whole world off
Keep your high heels on
Take it nice and slow
And make it last 'til dawn
All I wanna do is you
All I wanna do is you
I'll do anything you want me to
All I wanna do is you
I don't wanna eat
I don't wanna sleep
Don't wanna sit around and watch TV
When you're next to me it's where I wanna be
All I wanna, all I wanna, all I wanna do
All I wanna do is you
All I wanna do is you
I'll do anything you want me to
All I wanna do is you

Some 15 year old kid sits on his porch
Just half-past noon
Triying to figure out just what he's doing
Why he had to grow up so soon
With all the gangs, all the guns
Whatcha gonna learn in school
There's got to be some way out of here
He says: Man, this life is cruel
I knew this Puerto Rican girl
Who lied to change her life
She changed her name, her face
Because the grass looked
Greener on the other side
She turned her back, she ran away
Straight into the night
Her friends, her family feel the pain
But she's the one who cries
Tell me what you want
Tell me what you need
I want everything
I've had enough of havin nothing
I wont take just anything
I got my mind set on something
All I want is everything
It's my life Mr
I ain't running
I'm no puppet on a string
I want more than I see coming
All I want is everything
All I want is everything
Save a prayer for Donnie
He died in his room just the other day
His brother come home
Found him dead on the floor
With a needle in his vein
Cops came down with a body bag
They said Donnie was a casualty
I said: All it's about is the boy checked out
He couldn't handle reality
Tell me what you want
Tell me what you need
I want everything
I'v had enough of havin' nothing
I won't take just anything
I got my mind set on something
All I want is everything
It's my life Mr
I ain't running
I'm no puppet on a string
I want more than I see coming
All I want is everything
All I want is everything

There she stood in the street
Smiling from her head to her feet
I said: Hey, what is this?
Now baby, maybe she's in need of a kiss
I said: Hey, what's your name, baby
Maybe we can see things the same
Now don't you wait or hesitate
Let's move before they raise the parking rate
All right now baby, it's all right now
All right now baby, it's all right now
I took her home to my place
Watching every move on her face
She said: Look, what's your game, baby
Are you tryin' to put me in shame?
I said: Slow, don't go so fast
Don't you think that love can last?
She said: Love, Lord above
Now you're tryin' to trick me in love

First time I saw you girl
I knew that wouldn't long
I tried holdin' back my feeling
But you como on so strong
No one told me about her
But I know they all know
That I know about the girl's
That do the things you do
'Cause you're all talk, no action
You're playing those games with me baby
Well one of us has go to win
Some day all the boys are gonna find out
Thay you won't even play with them
You're runnin' out of numbers baby
You won't say no, you just say maybe
One of these days you're gonna get
What's comin' to you
'Cause you're all talk, no action
You better stop this foolin' around
You tore it up to cool me down
Stick and stones will break my bones
But their names could never hurt me
I ain't afraid of you running away
If you love me tonight and desert me

Maybe I didn't love you
Quite as often as I could have
Maybe I didn't treat you
Quite as good as I should have
If I made you feel second best
Girl I'm sorry I was blind
You were always on my mind
You were always on my mind
Maybe I didn't hold you
All those lonely, lonely times
And I guess I never told you
I'm so happy that you're mine
Little things I should have said and done
I just never took the time
You were always on my mind
You were always on my mind
Tell me, tell me that your
Sweet love hasn't died
And give me
Give me one more chance
To keep you satisfied
Satisfied
Little things I should have
Said and done
I just never took the time
You were always on my mind
You were always on my mind
You were always on my mind

O beautiful for spacious skies
For amber waves of grain
For purple mountain majesties
Above the fruited plain!
America! America!
God shed his grace on thee
And crown thy good with brotherhood
From sea to shining sea!
O beautiful for pilgrim feet
Whose stern impassioned stress
A thoroughfare for freedom beat
Across the wilderness!
America! America!
God mend thine every flaw
Confirm thy soul in self-control
Thy liberty in law!
O beautiful for heroes proved
In liberating strife
Who more than self the country loved
And mercy more than life!
America! America!
May God thy gold refine
Till all success be nobleness
And every gain divine!
O beautiful for patriot dream
That sees beyond the years
Thine alabaster cities gleam
Undimmed by human tears!
America! America!
God shed his grace on thee
And crown thy good with brotherhood
From sea to shining sea!
O beautiful for halcyon skies
For amber waves of grain
For purple mountain majesties
Above the enameled plain!
America! America!
God shed his grace on thee
Till souls wax fair as earth and air
And music-hearted sea!
O beautiful for pilgrims feet
Whose stem impassioned stress
A thoroughfare for freedom beat
Across the wilderness!
America! America!
God shed his grace on thee
Till paths be wrought through
Wilds of thought
By pilgrim foot and knee!
O beautiful for glory-tale
Of liberating strife
When once and twice
For man's avail
Men lavished precious life!
America! America!
God shed his grace on thee
Till selfish gain no longer stain
The banner of the free!
O beautiful for patriot dream
That sees beyond the years
Thine alabaster cities gleam
Undimmed by human tears!
America! America!
God shed his grace on thee
Till nobler men keep once again
Thy whiter jubilee!

I used to see you on every TV
Your smiling face looked back at me
I used to see you on every TV
Your smiling face looked back at me
Then they caught you with the girl next door
People's money piled on the floor
Accusations that you try to deny
Revelations and rumours begin to fly
Now you think about reaching out
Try to get some help from above
Now you think about reaching out
Try to get some help from above
Reporters crowd around your house
Going through your garbage like a pack of hounds
Speculating what they may find out
It don't matter now, you're all washed up
You wake up in the middle of the night
Your sheets are wet and your face is white
You tried to make a good thing last
How could something so good, go bad, so fast?
American dream, American dream
American dream, American dream
Don't know when things went wrong
Might have been when you were young and strong
Don't know when things went wrong
Might have been when you were young and strong
Reporters crowd around your house
Going through your garbage like a pack of hounds
Speculating what they may find out
It don't matter now, you're all washed up

Well she was an American girl
Raised on promises
She couldn't help thinkin'
That there was a little more to life somewhere else
After all it was a great big world
With lots of places to run to
And if she had to die tryin'
She had one little promise she was gonna keep
Oh, yeah, all right
Take it easy, baby
Make it last all night
She was an American girl
Well it was kinda cold that night
She stood alone on her balcony
Yeah, she could hear the cars roll by
Out on 441 like waves crashin' on the beach
And for one desperate moment
There he crept back in her memory
God it's so painful when something that's so close
Is still so far out of reach
Oh, yeah, all right
Take it easy, baby
Make it last all night
She was an American girl

Okay boys, let's do it!
I'm your backdoor Santa
I make my run at the break of day
They call me backdoor Santa
I make my run at the break of day
I keep the little girls happy, while the boys are out to play
Well I ain't like old Saint Nick, he don't come but once a year (once a year)
Well I ain't like old Saint Nick, he don't come but once a year
I come runnin' with my presents, every time you call me dear
I kept some change in my pocket, when the jumpin's goin' on
I gave a few pennies, so we could be alone
I kept that door open, in case anyone smelled a mouse
'Cause Jonny's in some trouble, there ain't no chimney in the house
Uh-oh, could be in some trouble boys
Hey Rudolph, Richie, get me outta here
They call me backdoor Santa
I make my run at the break of day
They call me backdoor Santa
I make my run at the break of day
I keep the little girls happy, while the boys are out to play
Ho ho ho ho (ho ho ho ho), hey hey hey hey (hey hey hey hey)
Ho ho ho ho (ho ho ho ho), hey hey hey hey (hey hey hey hey)
Ho ho ho ho (ho ho ho ho), hey hey hey hey (hey hey hey hey)
Ho ho ho ho (ho ho ho ho), hey hey hey hey (hey hey hey hey)
Ho ho ho ho (ho ho ho ho), hey hey hey hey (hey hey hey hey)
Ho ho ho ho (ho ho ho ho), merry ghristmas everybody
Merry Christmas 'y'all

One soft infested summer, me and Terry became friends
Trying in vain to breathe the fire we was born in
Catching rides to the outskirts, tying faith between our teeth
Sleeping in that old abandoned beach house, getting wasted in the heat
And hiding on the backstreets
Hiding on the backstreets
With a love so hard and filled with defeat
Running for our lives at night on them backstreets
Slow dancing in the dark on the beach at Stockton's Wing
Where desperate lovers park, we sat with the last of the Duke Street Kings
Huddled in our cars, waiting for the bells that ring
In the deep heart of the night they set us loose of everything
To go running on the backstreets
Running on the backstreets
Terry, you swore we'd live forever
Taking it on them backstreets together
Endless juke joints and Valentino drag
Where famous dancers scraped the tears up off the street, dressed down in rags
Running into the darkness, some hurt bad, some really dying
At night sometimes it seemed you could hear the whole damn city crying
Blame it on the lies that killed us, blame it on the truth that ran us down
You can blame it all on me, Terry, it don't matter to me now
When the breakdown hit at midnight, there was nothing to say
But I hated him, and I hated you when you went away
Laying here in the dark, you're like an angel on my chest
Just another tramp of hearts crying tears of faithlessness
Remember all the movies, Terry, we'd go see
Trying to learn to walk like the heroes we thought we had to be
And after all this time, to find we're just like all the rest
Stranded in the park and forced to confess
To hiding on the backstreets
Hiding on the backstreets
Where we swore forever friends
On the backstreets until the end
Hiding on the backstreets
Hiding on the backstreets
Hiding on the backstreets
Hiding on the backstreets

Lights out tonight, trouble in the heartland
Got a head-on collision smashin' in my guts, man
I'm caught in a crossfire that I don't understand
But there's one thing I know for sure
I don't give a damn for the same old played out scenes
I don't give a damn for just the in-betweens
Honey I want the heart I want the soul
I want control right now
Talk about a dream, try to make it real
You wake up in the night with a fear so real
Spend your life waiting for a moment that just don't come
Well don't waste your time waiting
Badlands you gotta live it every day
Let the broken hearts stand as the price you've gotta pay
We'll keep pushin' till it's understood
And these badlands start treating us good
Workin' in the field till you get your back burned
Workin' 'neath the wheels till you get your facts learned
Baby I got my facts learned real good right now
You better get it straight darling
Poor man wanna be rich, rich man wanna be king
And a king ain't satisfied till he rules everything
I wanna go out tonight, I wanna find out what I got
Now I believe in the love that you gave me
I believe in the faith that could save me
I believe in the hope and I pray that some day it will raise me above these
Badlands you gotta live it every day
Let the broken hearts stand as the price you've gotta pay
We'll keep pushin' till it's understood
And these badlands start treating us good
For the ones who had a notion, a notion deep inside
That it ain't no sin to be glad you're alive
I wanna find one face that ain't looking through me
I wanna find one place
I wanna spit in the face of these
Badlands you gotta live it every day
Let the broken hearts stand as the price you've gotta pay
We'll keep pushin' till it's understood
And these badlands start treating us good

You were five when I was six
We rode on horses made of sticks
When you were 9, I was 10
You swore your love to the end
Bang bang

My baby shot me down

Take me now baby here as I am
Pull me close try and understand
I work all day out in the hot Sun
Stay with me now till the mornin' comes
Come on now try and understand
The way I feel when I'm in your hands
Take me now as the Sun descends
They can't hurt you now
They can't hurt you now
They can't hurt you now
Because the night belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to us
Because the night belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to us
What I got I have earned
What I'm not I have learned
Desire and hunger is the fire I breathe
Just stay in my bed till the morning comes
Come on now try and understand
The way I feel when I'm in your hands
Take me now as the Sun descends
They can't hurt you now
They can't hurt you now
They can't hurt you now
Because the night
Your love is here and now
The vicious circle turns and burns without
Though I cannot live forgive me now
The time has come to take this moment and
They can't hurt you now
Because the night

I just want all those modern romances
Always being in love
When any girl smiled at me I went wild at the touch of her clothes
Then bang it's off before I know it
Poor broken hearted me
Better think twice before falling in love again
Better think twice before falling in love
Jackie's all alone in her room with the TV on
And she's crying, crying
Wondering about how her and Joey been getting along
All this lying, lying
Tell her this, tell her that
Where's these lies gonna end
Things would be much better if her and Joey just stayed friends
Better think twice before falling in love again
Better think twice before falling in love
What's in it for you?
He's trying to shoot you down
Long hot summer nights
Go out now and find that girl and hold her tight
Like she's the only girl in the world
You better think twice
Better think twice before falling in love again
Better think twice before falling in love
Better think twice before falling in love again
Better think twice before falling in love

Since you're been gone now honey
Life ain't nothing but sad luck days
I begged on my knees now, sugar
You acted like you never knew my name
My friends saw you at the station
I guess you must have missed your train
Tell me is it 'cause you love me, Billy
Or is it just because you love the pain?
Billy, Billy
Ain't love hard to explain?
For a debutante you're a real hard woman
But I love you just the same
How come you're sad when I get happy?
Why do you laugh when I want to cry?
Tell me why when I say I need you
You turn around and you say goodbye
Why do you think that a heart's so fragile?
Can you tell me why love's so blind?
Just like a magnet you pull me under
I can't resist you, we're two of a kind
Billy, Billy
We're better lovers than friends
Life is like a movie but this ain't pretend
There really doesn't have to be a happy end
I never said you had to walk on water
Or that I could ever stop the rain
Sometimes we break up just to make up, baby
And we don't care who's to blame
Hey, hey, hey
Billy, Billy
Can we be lovers and friends
Life is like a movie but this ain't pretend
There really doesn't have to be a happy end
Billy, Billy
Ain't love hard to explain?
Billy, Billy
I love you just the same

I'll have a blue Christmas without you
I'll be so blue thinking about you
Decorations of red on a green Christmas tree
Won't be the same here if you're not here with me
And when those blue snowflakes start falling
Is when those blue memories start calling
Then you'll be doing all right with your Christmas of white
But I'll have a blue, blue, blue Christmas
Decorations of red on a green Christmas tree
Just won't be the same here if you're not here with me
And when those blue snowflakes start falling

You'll be doing all right with your Christmas of white

You call every hour, but there's nothing to say
So talk to me now, before it's too late
Oh they say it couldn't happen
But I saw your picture breathe
That fifty dollar doctor said your love is a disease
I'm alright, I'm okay
Still I don't know how, and I don't know why
But the talk turns to shop, and so we stand on the edge of goodbye
Is this the end of the beginning, or beginning of an end
Are you friend or the enemy, or enemy or the friend
I walk the borderline
Between day and the night, wrong and the right
Borderline
The voices they scream from inside of me
On the borderline
I walk the borderline
I hear talk on the streets, I hear rumors of you
The people I meet say, that the lies are all true
And I wake up in a cold sweat, find you lying fast asleep
Is my dream a reality, reality a dream
I've crossed the borderline
Between day and the night, wrong and the right
Borderline
The voices they scream from inside of me
On the borderline
I walk the borderline
I walk the borderline
Between day and the night, wrong and the right
Borderline
The voices they scream from inside of me
On the borderline
I walk the borderline
Yeah, yeah, yeah

When tears are in your eyes
I'll dry them all
I'm on your side
Oh, when times get rough
And friends just can't be found

I will lay me down
Like a bridge over troubled water

When you're on the street
When evening falls so hard
I will comfort you
I'll take your part
Oh, when darkness comes
And pain is all around
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will lay me down
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will lay me down
Sail on silver girl
Sail on by
Your time has come to shine
All your dreams are on their way
See how they shine
Oh, if you need a friend
I'm sailing right behind
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will ease your mind

Do you know I'm leaving on the midnight train?
Bought a one way token and I won't be back again
Would you smash the spider
Hidden in your web
Move before you're bitten
And you trapped me in your bed
The girl admits she tells me lies
She took my soul and I'm taking it back
Broken promise painted on your lips
Only loneliness
Got no love to give, only lies
Got no love to give, only lies
The girl admits she tells me lies
She took my soul and I'm taking it back
Broken promises painted on your lips
Got no love to give
All your promises are only lies
Only lies fill your promises
Painted on your lips
Got no love to give
All your promises are only lies
Broken promises

All your promises are only lies
Got no love to give, only lies

Louie Louie you're gonna cry
She was black as the night
Louie was whiter than white
Danger danger when you taste brown sugar
He fell in love overnight
Nothing bad, it was good
Louie had the best that he could
Took her home to meet momma and papa
He knew just where he stood
Louie, Louie, Louie, Louie
Louie Louie you're gonna cry
As he stood in the night
Knowing what's wrong and right
He took her home to meet momma and papa
Man they had a terrible fight
Now Louie, he caused a scene
He was wishin' that it was a dream
Makes no difference if you're black or white
As long as you know what I mean

Sayonara, adiós, auf wiedersehen, farewell
Adieu, goodnight, guten abend
Here's a last song you can sell
Let's call it Burning Bridges
It's a singalong as well
Ciao, adieu, goodnight, guten abend
Play it for your friends in hell
Someone shut the lights off, turn the page
The stories I could write
I've seen a million faces and I've lived a couple lives
Here's our history for all to see
The smiles and all the scars
First the rising, then the falling
Call this chapter Shooting Stars
(Must sound good from where you are!)
Sayonara, adiós, auf wiedersehen, farewell
Adieu, goodnight, guten abend

Ah, check the box, yeah, mark this day
There's nothing more to say
After 30 years of loyalty, they let you dig a grave
Now, maybe you could learn to sing or even strum along
But I'll give you half the publishing
You're why I wrote this song
(Everybody, sing along!)
Sayonara, adiós, auf wiedersehen, farewell
Adieu, goodnight, guten abend
Here's one last song you can sell
Let's call it Burning Bridges
It's a singalong as well
Hope my money and my masters
Buy a front row seat in hell

Well I'm the king of the road
Ain't got no place to go, no place I call home
Seen the world from behind this old wheel
Driving away from those feelings I feel
Desire cuts like a knife
I'll leave you bleeding but I'll make you feel alright
I love you but don't hold me too tight
Don't put up a fight cause these wheels gotta roll
There ain't nobody, ain't nobody, ain't no savior gonna save my soul
Well I've been searching for a rainbow and a pot of gold
That's mine to hold that can't be bought or can't be sold
I'm a poet, I'm a preacher, got a lawyer's tongue
I can sit here at home but I ain't nobody's son
Before you get too close you best understand
I'm a Cadillac man
I'm a liar, I'm a lover, I'm a lawman's gun
I'm a sailor to the sea, I'm born of gypsy blood
I'm the aces in a card player's hand
I'm a Cadillac man
And I've been driving all night
Chain-smoking cigarettes and chasing tail lights
Through the smoke I see the deal of my life
And if you got ten rounds then you got a hell of a fight
So if you want to cry, well then you cry to me
If you want to lie, I'll let you lie to me
If you want to laugh, well then I'll play the clown
You can laugh 'till you cry
Everybody, everybody
Everybody's got the truth to hide
There ain't nobody, ain't nobody ever satisfied
Or justified, or criticized and crucified
I'm a poet, I'm a preacher, got a lawyer's tongue
I can stay here at home but I ain't nobody's son
Before you get too close you best understand
I'm a Cadillac man
Well I'm a liar, I'm a lover, I'm a lawman's gun
I'm a sailor to the sea, I'm born of gypsy blood
I'm the aces in a card player's hand
I'm a Cadillac man
I'm just a Cadillac man (keep on riding)
Cadillac man
I'm doing the best that I can
I'm a Cadillac man
Woke up this morning
Looked in the mirror saw the miles in my eyes
For one moment I thought my big deal had just passed me by
My Cadillac died
But I just cracked a smile and the mirror said ride
Cadillac man
I'm just a Cadillac man
Cadillac man
Well I'm a poet I'm a preacher, got a lawyer's tongue
I can stay here at home but I ain't nobody's son
Before you get too close you best understand
I'm a Cadillac man
I'm a liar, I'm a lover, I'm a lawman's gun
I'm a sailor to the sea, I'm born of gypsy blood
I'm the aces in a card player's hand
I'm a Cadillac man
I'm a Cadillac man
A Cadillac man
Cadillac man
A Cadillac man

Dressed up for a big date
Like Halloween day but it was Fourth of July now
A car crash with a suitcase and a painted face
She was one of a kind
She wears a plastic crown like Cinderella
And roller skates in bed
He rides the greyhound from his hometown
When he comes around cause they don't let him drive now
Mixed up as a milkshake
But make no mistake
Crash looking at the stars
You and me
We're invincible together
We can be also tragical, whatever
Dressed up just like Ziggy but he couldn't play guitar
Captain Crash and the beauty queen from Mars
Share a toothpick, trading lipstick
Watching traffic for days at the diner
Holding hands, making big plans
Playing superman, he was wearing eyeliner
Another local legend and his longtime lucky charm
You and me
We're invincible together
We can be also tragical, whatever
Dressed up just like Ziggy but he couldn't play guitar
Captain Crash and the beauty queen from Mars
They're drunk on love as you can get
Getting high on lust and cigarettes
Living life with no regrets
At least they're gonna try to fly
You and me
We're invincible together
We can be also tragical, whatever
We're Sid and Nancy
Fred and Ginger
Clyde and Bonnie
Liz and Richard
Kurt and Courtney
Baccal and Bogie
Joltin' Joe and Mrs. Monroe
Here's captain crash and the beauty queen from Mars

My child arrived just the other day
Came to the world in the usual way
But there were planes to catch and bills to pay
He learned to walk while I was away
He was talkin: Fore I knew it
And as he grew he said
I'm gonna be like you, dad
You know I'm gonna be like you
And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon
Little boy blue and the man 'n the Moon
When you comin' home?
Son, I don't know when
We'll get together then
You know we'll have a good time then
Well, my son turned ten just the other day
He said: Thanks for the ball, dad
Come on, let's play
Could you teach me to throw?
I said: Not today, I got a lot to do
He said: That's okay, and he walked away and he smiled and he said
You know, I'm gonna be like him, yeah
You know I'm gonna be like him
Well, he came from college just the other day
So much like a man I just had to say
I'm proud of you. Could you sit for a while?
He shook his head and he said with a smile
What I'd really like, dad, is to borrow the car keys
See you later
Can I have them please?
I've long since retired, my son's moved away
I called him up just the other day
I'd like to see you, if you don't mind
He said: I'd love to, dad, if I could finnnnd the time
You see my new job's a hassle and the kids have the flu
But it's sure nice talkin' to you, dad
It's been sure nice talkin' to you
And as I hung up the phone it occurred to me
He'd grown up just like me
My boy was just like me

The snow's coming down
I'm watching it fall
Lot's of people around
Baby please come home
The church bells in town
Well their singing our song
What a happy sound
Baby please come home
They're singing Deck the Halls
But it's not like Chritmas at all
I remember when you were here
And all the fun we had last year
Pretty lights on the tree
I'm watching them shine
You should be here with me
Baby please come home
They're singing Deck the Halls
But it's not like Christmas at all
I remember when you were here
And all the fun we had last year
If there was a way
I'd hold back these tears
But it's Christmas day
Baby please come home
Baby please come home
Baby please come home
Baby please come home
Baby please come home

Gently approaching you, but not knowing what to say
Praying you don't have a man
Offering you a drink, whatever your taste is
Maybe you might have a shot
Shot of your cocoa brown with me
Cool with my cocoa brown
Thats what I want
Cuz she got such style I like
So cool and brown
Cool with my cocoa brown
No doubt about it
From the moment that I looked in her eyes
Mentally, she's so supreme, but not knowing who to trust
Softly, I take your hand
Stroking on your face
Cant help anticipating, leaving after we dance
Oh, yeah, my cocoa brown, brown, brown, yeah
I get down, who loves cocoa brown, cocoa brown
I want the sound, love the voice, cocoa brown, cocoa brown
I get down, who loves cocoa brown, cocoa brown
I want the sound, who loves cocoa brown, cocoa brown

Hello, my name is
It really don’t matter know
A book of blank pages
Anything you want I’ll be
Write a little love letter on me
Oh make me fit just right like a hand in the glove
As close as the lipstick on your coffee cup
Paint me the picture you’re dreaming of
If that ain’t enough
Colour me in
Any way you wanna begin, I’m in
Girl, you've got me under your spell, I fell
Any shade you wanna use
Colour me just right for you
Colour me in
This might sound crazy
Do anything you wanna do
Your kiss can save me
Let me wrap these arms around you
I wanna be the song that's stuck in your head
Close as a prayer that you’ll never forget
All I can say is just what I said
We'll get there again
Colour me in
Any way you wanna begin, I’m in
Girl you’ve got under your spell, I fell
Any shade you wanna use
Colour me just right for you
Colour me in
Let your imagination run wild
All I wanna do is make you smile
And I've got all night
Hello, my name is
My name is
Colour me in
Any way you wanna begin, I’m in
Girl, you've got me under your spell, I fell
Any shade you wanna use
Colour me just right for you
Colour me in

Now that you're gone, I can see what
Was going on and how you lied
When you'd said you'd never love again
Friends telephone and they say
You weren't out alone last night
Can't you see that this broken heart
Is killing me
Another night is falling
And now my heart is calling you back to me
Come back 'cause I need your love
Come back got to have your love
Come back bring your loving back to me
Come back 'cause its been so long
Come back, and I can't go on
Come back bring your loving back to me
You play with words play with love
Its just your silly way
I'm a fool 'cause I need you by my side again
Now its too late you walk by
With another man
And I stand alone
'Cause I know that you're not coming home
Another night is falling
And now my heart is calling you back to me
Come back 'cause I need your love
Come back got to have your love
Come back bring your loving back to me
Come back 'cause its been so long
Come back, and I can't go on
Come back bring your loving back to me
Another night is falling
And now my heart is calling you back to me
Come back 'cause I need your love
Come back got to have your love
Come back bring your loving back to me
Come back 'cause its been so long
Come back, and I can't go on
Come back bring your loving back to me

Yo no vi las flores marchitar
Ni ese frío en tus ojos al mirar
No vi la realidad
Me ibas a dejar
Dicen que la vida, baby, no es como la ves
Para aprender hay que caer
Para ganar hay que perder
Lo di todo por ti
Lloré y lloré y juré que no iba a perderte
Traté y traté de negar este amor tantas veces, baby
Si mis lágrimas fúeron en vano
Si al final yo te amé demasiado
Como yo, como yo nadie te ha amado
Cada hora, una eternidad
Cada amanecer, un comenzar
Ilusiones nada más
Que fácil fue soñar
Tantas noches de intimidad
Parecían no acabar
Nos dejamos desafiar
Y hoy nada es igual
Sé que en verdad el amor al final siempre duele
No lo pude salvar y hoy voy a pagarlo con creces, baby
Si mis lágrimas fúeron en vano
Si al final yo te amé demasiado
Como yo, como yo nadie te ha amado
Esta vez la pasión ha ganado
Y por eso sigo esperando
Como yo, como yo nadie te ha amado
Lloré y lloré y juré que no iba a perderte
Traté y traté de negar este amor tantas veces, baby
Si mis lágrimas fueron en vano
Si al final yo te amé demasiado
Como yo, como yo nadie te ha amado
Esta vez la pasión ha ganado
Y por eso sigo esperando
Como yo, como yo nadie te ha amado
Como yo, como yo nadie te ha amado
Como yo, como yo nadie te ha amado

I've been waitin' for this scene to end
I don't need somebody baby, I need a friend
I work all day just like doin' time
I've stood tall through the fires of hell
And I've walked through enemy lines
So now you've gone and built a wall around you
Its gonna take a heart to knock it down too
Deep cuts the night, when you're without love
Deep cuts the night, when you're without love
Deep cuts the night, and it's bringing me down
Its bringing me down
If I could be the hero in your masquerade
I could sweep you off your feet and take you far away
There ain't no saviors in the real world
There's only broken hearts
And souls for you and me girl
Now you've gone and built a wall around you
It's gonna take a heart to knock it down too
Deep cuts the night, when you're without love
Deep cuts the night, when you're without love
Deep cuts the night, when you're without love
Deep cuts the night, well its bringing me down
So load your guns and fire away
All it takes is one fair shot
To blow your world away
Deep cuts the night, when you're without love
Deep cuts the night, when you're without love
Deep cuts the night, and it's bringin' me down
It's bringin' me down

I don't wanna lose this thing we got
To tell you the truth babe we've been losing a lot
You don't understand the things I say
The clothes I wear or the friends I've made
Tell me girl are you my baby, oh, yeah
Yeah you drive me crazy, oh, yeah
I don't wanna love you
Had enough of those blues
I ain't gonna love you
I just wanna do it to ya
Drive me insane
A lethal angel that ain't gonna change
I'll do it bad but I like the floor
You're begging for mercy when I'm begging for more
You got it going down onto me, oh, yeah
And every time you kiss me, oh, yeah oh, yeah
I don't wanna love you
I've had too much of those blues
And I don't wanna hold you
I just wanna, just wanna do it to ya
Coming on the b section alright, after one more time around
B section!
Baby I've been all around the world
I've seen and loved every kind of girl
I can't say they've been all on time
Every day I like it on time
I ain't gonna love you
I blew holes in my shoes
And I ain't gonna love you
I just wanna do it to ya, do it to ya
Do it to you, do it to ya
Just wanna do it to ya
Do it to ya

I walked down the street
People passing me by
They look me up and down
But they don't look me in the eye
I'm just another stranger
In my own home town
Looking for an angel
But heaven can't be found
I say: Hey, are you lonely tonight
Hey, hey, hey I'm gonna make it through
But that don't make it right
Does anybody really fall in love anymore?
Does anybody really give their heart to somebody?
Does anybody really ever open that door?
I know, I know, you've got to love somebody
I know, I know, I've got to find somebody to love
There's a sad face in the mirror
And I'm sad to say it's me
Like a ghost up in the attic
Only love can set him free
I've been running around in circles
On this roller coaster ride
There's a lonely world around me
I get sucked in by the tide
I said: Hey, love ain't no crime
So why is everybody so afraid to cross that line?
Hey, hey, hey, I'll be alright
'Cause I know that someone somewhere's
Gonna say these words tonight

When I come home, it's late, I feel so all alone
What was my mistake, baby, why don't you care at all?
Well if it's just a change in you, I'll adjust
But if you're true give me a sign of your trust
And am I supposed to be true to you
Don't keep me wonderin', do I still have your love
Don't keep me wonderin', if you've given up
When I come to bed, you're there, but I feel so all alone

Take it without you, so baby please hang on)

Excuse me love
Can I come dance with you?
Uh, yeah
(Hmm, yeah)
2000, Jon B ish uh yeah
All you people in the club feelin' it
Uh yeah, come on baby now
Baby I had to stop for a second on the balcony
Scopin' you down, you're lookin' fly to me
All dressed up, and buying your own drinks
And that ain't right
Not that you can't handle it on your own
But your too damn fly to drink all alone
Can I come bubble with you?
To you - I'mma make a toast, come on
Don't talk
Baby just move with me
Take a sip
Kind of got you feelin' fizzy
It's alright, so rock with me
If it's alright with you, oh baby
Baby, you got me high dancin' close with the Kana perfume
Smellin' all good
It's gettin' hot in the room
All pressed on you
And I know you feel it too
And that's alright
Pardon me, I'mma back up and be a gentleman
And if it's really real then you can tell me when
And that's when she pulled me close
And said let's do it again, come on
Uh, come on baby now, uh
Uh, come on baby now, uh
Uh, come on baby now
Girl it's alright to relax your mind
Cause you came out to enjoy yourself
It's on you and nobody else
Come on and bubble with me

I know it's been a long time, since I called you last
Remember all those dreams that we had, the time went by so damn fast
You said I had to flaunt those girls I kept by my sides for kicks
You let the rumors fly, it's nothing new
What those little boys will do to get their fix
You broke my heart when you said goodbye, bye, bye
You believed him when he told you a lie
Without your love baby I'm gonna die
Don't you believe him (don't you believe him)
He's gonna fill you up with lies
Don't you believe him darling, (don't you believe him)
He's gone too far this time
Since you left me baby, since you gone and stole my heart
I remember the very night that I broke down and fell apart
Girl you don't remember, what I'm up here to be
Baby, baby don't you know, you're the biggest part of me
It broke my heart when you said good bye, bye, bye
You believed him when he told you a lie
Without your love baby I'm gonna die
Don't you believe him (don't you believe him)
He's gonna fill you up with lies
Don't you believe him darling, (don't you believe him)
He's gone too far this time
Broke my heart when you said goodbye, bye, bye
You believed him when he told you a lie
Without your love baby I'm gonna die
Don't you believe him (don't you believe him)

Don't you believe him darling, (don't you believe him)
He's gone too far this time
Don't you believe him, don't you believe him
Don't you believe him, don't you believe him

Day after day I'm more confused
So I look for the light in the pouring rain
You know that's a game that I hate to lose
I'm feelin' the strain, ain't it a shame
Oh, give me the beat, boys, and free my soul
I wanna get lost in your rock and roll and drift away
Oh, give me the beat, boys, and free my soul
I wanna get lost in your rock and roll and drift away
Beginning to think that I'm wastin' time
I don't understand the things I do
The world outside looks so unkind
I'm countin' on you to carry me through
And when my mind is free
You know a melody can move me
And when I'm feelin' blue
The guitar's comin' through to soothe me
Thanks for the joy that you've given me
I want you to know I believe in your song
Rhythm and rhyme and harmony
You help me along makin' me strong

Baby, I've been thinking
It's too hard to speak these nights
Can I confess what's on my chest
What's really on my mind
See, I never was scared of nothing
There was nothing that we couldn't do
We used to think that
We could walk on water
Just because we wanted to
And it all seemed so easy
When we were living not just alive
We talked about dreams
And how we would like to spend our lives
When freedom was a tank of gas
On a long summer night
To drive, just drive
Can you keep a secret baby?
If you can't, just lie
Yeah, I want to scream
When I have this dream
That my whole life passed me by
And they sold my heart for diamonds
And they sold some pride for gold
There's lots of things that I can't get back
That the record company owns
When 17 has turned 30
Its all gone kiss it goodbye
Hey, baby, maybe we aint kids no more
But I'm too young to die
There's still some freedom in this tank of gas
If youre by my side
We'll drive, just drive
Don't want no airplanes, no ticket on a fast train
All I wanted was a two-lane
With you by my side
We'll drive, all night long, get on board
We'll drive, with the radio on
You can lean your head on my shoulder
And just for a while
Forget about the world, baby, mile after mile
We'll drive, all night long yeah, you want a ride?
No airplane, no ticket on a fast train
All I wanted was a two-lane
And you by my side
We'll drive, all night long, get on board
We'll drive, with the radio on baby all right

I got your picture on my phone
Your voice in my head
I'm lying here alone
Restless in some faraway bed
The stars will falling down
And I'm half a world away
I'm just trying to close the distance
To feel each breath you take
When the bridge is burning
And I'm loosing my faith
And I'm trying to find my way towards the truth
Like a wild arrow flying
And I'm blindly running
From everything I thought I knew
And every road leads home to you
Home to you
So you got me to believe
Made me turn on a dime
The writing on the wall
Right in front of me
Every song, every rhyme
But I don't need a thousand words
I need you save in my arms
I'll be standing strong
I'll keep holding on
When life tries tearing us apart
When the bridge is burning
And I'm loosing my faith
And I'm trying to find my way towards the truth
Like a wild arrow flying
And I'm blindly running
From everything I thought I knew
No I ain't regretting
Just how lost I'm getting
Or the red lights I've been blowing through
My foot will find the pedal
As I'm counting the lines
Every road leads home to you
Every road leads home to you
Home
Roads still leads me home to you
Sometimes I don't see the signs
The Headlights make me blind
The Roads still leads me home to you
When the bridge is burning
And I'm loosing my faith
And I'm trying to find my way towards the truth
Like a wild arrow flying
And I'm blindly running
Everything I thought I knew
No I ain't regretting
Just how lost I'm getting
Or the red lights I've been blowing through
My foot will find the pedal
As I'm counting the lines
Every road leads home to you
Every road leads home to you
Home to you
Home to you
Home to you
Every road leads home to you
Home to you
Every road
Leads home to you
Every road leads home to you

When your day is long
And the night the night is yours alone
When you're sure you've had enough of this life
Hang on
Don't let yourself go
'Cause everybody cries
And everybody hurts, sometimes
Sometimes everything is wrong
Now it's time to sing along
When your day is night alone (hold on, hold on)
If you feel like letting go (hold on)
If you think you've had too much of this life
To hang on
'Cause everybody hurts
Take comfort in your friends
Everybody hurts
Don't throw your hand, oh no
Don't throw your hand
If you feel like you're alone
No, no, no, you're not alone
If you're on your own in this life
The days and nights are long
When you think you've had too much of this life
To hang on
Well, everybody hurts
Sometimes, everybody cries
And everybody hurts, sometimes
But everybody hurts, sometimes
So hold on
Hold on
Everybody hurts
You're not alone

How can I defend
Let's live for now and not then
We're chasing taillights, let'em fade into the
Distance
Let's say the engine stalled and start again
Turn around, let's turn around
It's a dark road we'd been heading down
Trust me tonight
I swear I know where we are
We're gonna run all the lights
We're gonna blow right through the radar
Fast cars
We are fast cars
How can I pretend
The signs don't say: Dead end?
So many hearts just wind up in a junkyard
And memories are nothing but spare parts
Turn around, just turn around
We'll leave the past behind us now
Come on, we ain't gonna crash
It's time we ain't slowing down
We'll pull ahead of the pack
Slipping through the cracks
'Cause we are
Fast cars
On a long ride
Take your foot off the brake
Let? S just put it in drive
We are fast cars
On the inside
There? S no turning back
On the highway of life
Fast cars
We are fast cars
Shala, shala
Flying through the stop signs
Shala, shala
Running over the bad times
Shala, shala
Cutting down the daylight
Counting deep like white lines
Holding on for our lives
We are fast cars
We are fast cars
On a long ride
Take your foot off the brake
Let's just put it in drive
We are fast cars
On the inside
There's no turning back
On this highway tonight
Shala, shala
Shala, shala
We are fast cars
Shala, shala
We are fast cars
We are fast cars

Father time
I couldn't make her wanna stay
I couldn't seem to find the words to say
Now I have to live in yesterday
Father time
I thought that you were on my side
I thought that I could keep our love alive
I thought that I could keep her satisfied
The clock keeps tickin' and I keep on thinkin' 'bout you
I'm knockin' at the door of your heart but I can't break through
Father time
Grant me just another day
Of our love I tried to make her stay
Father time
Don't tell me it's too late
All my life you know that I would wait
Father time
Now she's gone
She didn't even say good-bye
I guess she didn't have the heart to try
She didn't even have the guts to lie
Father time
Only you can turn the page
And close the curtain on this empty stage
Only you can take my pain away
And my heart keeps breakin' and my body keeps aching for you
It's time to hold on but there's nothin' left to hold on to
Father time
Grant me just another day
Of our love I tried to make her stay
Father time
Don't tell me it's too late
All my life you know that I would wait
Father time
Father, father can't you see I'm depending on you
I'm dying at the door to your heart and I can't break through
Father time
Grant me just another day
Of our love I tried to make her stay
Father time
Don't tell me it's too late
All my life you know that I would wait
Father time
She's your child make her mine
Father time

I see you looking over your shoulder
Tell me who do you think's out there
You're reaching for your four leaf clover
But baby there ain't no luck down there
I swear that there's no heart in this city
It's here the slogan reads: Do your time
Everybody's doing theirsentence
It's just there ain't nobody here
Who knows just what's the crime
I watched my father live a lie here
I'd rather die than fade away
I read the rules
And yeah I know them
Still you ain't ever gonna
Make me play the game of fear, fear, fear, fear
Running with the rats
Through the city
Makes you feel like you're a partner in crime
Girl once you won't stop to watch
That little girl did
Hey baby won't you stop and hear me
Just being here we're breathing heart attacks
We can run and chase
The setting Sun we can run
And we won't ever look back
Take my hand I know we'll make it
I'll let nothing slow us down I know you want to curse
This place but there's only
One thing that's stopping us now
Fear fear fear of a new thing fear fear fear
Of the brass ring
You ain't one for taking chances
You work and live and breathe that 9 to 5
Still that's what you call living
That's surviving to me
And surviving is living to die in
Fear

You never know how much I love ya
Never know how much I care
When you put your arms around me
I get a feelin' that's so hard to bear
You give me fever
When you kiss me
Fever when you hold me tight
Fever (fever, burn through) in the mornin'
An' fever all through the night
Listen to me, baby
Hear ev'ry word I say
No one could love you the way I do
'Cause they don't know how to love you my way
You give me fever
When you kiss me
Fever when you hold me tight
Fever (fever, burn through) in the mornin'
An' fever all through the night
Bless my soul, I love you
Take this heart away
Take these arms I'll never use
An' just believe in what my lips have to say
You give me fever
When you kiss me
Fever when you hold me tight
Fever (fever, burn through) in the mornin'
Fever all through the night
Sun lights up the daytime
Moon lights up the night
My eyes light up when you call my name
'Cause I know you're gonna treat me right
You give me fever
When you kiss me
Fever when you hold me tight
Fever (fever, burn through) in the mornin'
An' fever all through the night

I'm pulling you close, you just say no
You say you don't like it, but girl I know youre a liar
'Cause when we kiss, fire
Late at night I'm takin you home
I say I wanna stay, you say you wanna be alone
You say you don't love me, girl you can't hide your desire
'Cause when we kiss, fire
You had a hold on me, right from the start
A grip so tight I couldn't tear it apart
My nerves all jumpin actin like a fool
Well your kisses they burn but your heart stays cool
Romeo and juliet, samson and delilah
Baby you can bet their love they didn't deny
Your words say split but your words they lie

You say that I'm a hopeless romantic
'Cause I've been in love before
But since the first nite I saw you
Things haven't been the same
I didn't know you had a steady guy
Always hangin' round
But I want you to know baby anytime
You want to change your plans
For you, I wanna be around
For you, I'd laugh my life away
For you, baby, I would
If you let me
I saw you last nite at the drive-in
You look lonely all alone
Your eyes were glued to the picture
Were you wishing you were home
Do you stay up nites like I do
Do you start dialing the telephone
Do you dream of us
Lovers out on the town
Holdin' hands and foolin around
Well I want you to know darlin'
We could be romeo & juliet
Baby, tonite if we go all the way
Well, you and I
You just gotta say
I love you
And then we're out among the stars
Come on, come on
For you, I would be around
For you, loving when the Sun go down
For you, baby, I would
If you let me
For you

Santa, where's your old red suit
Santa, where's your beard
Santa where did your belly go?
This sure is getting weird
Why do you have the diamond stud
Shining in your nose
Why did you go and get so buffed
Wearin' designer clothes
It's just not right
It's breakin' nature's laws
Nobody wants a tripped-out, trendy, flipped-out Funky Santa
What a sight to see
Lookin' fine at Christmas time
And funky as he wants to be
Santa where's your reindeer gone
Why you drivin' that SUV
Is there something wrong with you
Or is there something wrong with me
I know you've got to express yourself
You've got the right to change
But a Santa with his hair dyed black
Tell me that ain't strange
It's just not right
It's breakin' nature's laws
Nobody wants
A freaky, trashy, flashy, funky Santa
What a sight to see
Lookin' fine at Christmas time
And funky as he wants to be
But Santa he just smiles and says
Wait a minute please
There's just one man who puts the presents
Underneath the trees
So make your list, I'll check it twice, like I always do
I'm still the same old man inside, but outside I'm keepin' it new
It's just not right
It's breakin' nature's law
Nobody wants
A punked-out, in-crowd, pop star, funky Santa
What a sight to see
Lookin' fine at Christmas time
As funky as he wants to be

I know you want me but you look away,
I keep so cool back cause you're so afraid
You keep your distance
And crave my caress,
We all make our choices
We all stand the test
Yes I know, where you go
In the game of the heart,
I hear you callin' my name,
Here in the darkness the truth puts an end to your game.
In the game of the heart, you know that I know you're mine,
Youll have to face that alone at the end of the line.
Feelin' so naked we ache for the touch,
I feel your eyes on me, they swallow me up
Show me your fears and I'll put them to rest
We all make our choices we all stand the test.
Yes I know, where you go.
In the game of the heart
I hear you callin' my name,
Here in the darkness the truth puts an end to your game
In the game of the heart, you know that I know you're mine,
Youll have the face that alone at the end of the line
You know you're mine
And you think that you need protection,
End so we build up these walls
Well I'm gonna be the exception
So let's lift our voices and cry
Here's to the game of the heart.
Game of the heart,
I hear you callin' my name,
Here in the darkness the truth puts an end to your game.
In the game of the heart, you know that I know you're mine,
Youll have to face that alone at the end of the line.
In the game of the heart.
Game of the heart, game of the heart.
Game of the heart.

I don't need a credit card
To buy your love
I don't need no Cadillacs
To match your leather gloves
'Cause baby I'm going crazy
Take you by the hand
I need your attention
Not some blank psycho stare
You gotta give me some lovin' Charlene
Gimme some lovin' Charlene
I know your mama and she don't like me
Cause I'm not the type of boy
She wants you to see
But I wanna take you home and go for a ride
Cause I got the poison
Let me inside
You gotta give me some lovin' Charlene
Gimme some lovin' Charlene
I like your made-up-eyes
'Cause they glow like fire
I like your moves
'Cause you never tire
And you're familiar with the backseat
Take your sweet time
You build me up so hot
Love's a crime
You gotta give me some lovin'
Charlene
Gimme some lovin' Charlene
Charlene (7x)
I don't need a credit card
To buy your love
I don't need no Cadillac
To match your leather gloves
'Cause I am going crazy
When I take your hand
I need your attention
Not some blank psycho stare
Gimme some lovin' Charlene
Gimme some lovin' Charlene
I know your mama and she don't like me
But I'm not the type of boy
She wants you to see
But I wanna take you home and go for a ride
Cause I got the poison
Let me inside
Gimme some lovin' Charlene
Gimme some lovin' Charlene, Charlene
I like your made-up-eyes
They glow like fire
I like your moves
'Cause you never tire
And you're familiar with the backseat
Take your sweet time
You build me up so hot
Love's a crime
Gimme some lovin' Charlene
Gimme some lovin' Charlene, Charlene

I had a friend was a big baseball player
Back in high school
He could throw that speedball by you
Make you look like a fool boy
Saw him the other night at this roadside bar
I was walking in, he was walking out
We went back inside sat down had a few drinks
But all he kept talking about was
Glory days well they'll pass you by
Glory days in the wink of a young girl's eye
Glory days, glory days
Well there's a girl that lives up the block
Back in school she could turn all the boy's heads
Sometimes on a friday I'll stop by
And have a few drinks after she put her kids to bed
Her and her husband bobby well they split up
I guess it's two years gone by now
We just sit around talking about the old times
She says when she feels like crying
She starts laughing thinking about
Glory days well they'll pass you by
Glory days in the wink of a young girl's eye
Glory days, glory days
Now I think I'm going down to the well tonight
And I'm going to drink till I get my fill
And I hope when I get old I don't sit around thinking about it
But I probably will
Yeah, just sitting back trying to recapture
A little of the glory of, well time slips away
And leaves you with nothing mister but
Boring stories of
Glory days well they'll pass you by
Glory days in the wink of a young girl's eye
Glory days, glory days
Well they'll pass you by
Glory days in the wink of a young girl's eye
Glory days, glory days

I got some blood under my nails
I got some mud on my face
My voice is shot, I'm going grey
These muscles all ache
Don't cry for me, I'm the life of the party
I'm smiling most of the time
I may be gritting my teeth
Can't get back where we started
These days I'm doing just fine
God bless this mess, this mess is mine
Won't pound my chest or criticize
I must confess: I've lived, I've died
God bless this mess, this mess is mine
God bless this mess, this mess is mine
I knew every buried body, paid for each headstone
I may have led the prayers in public, but I cried alone
Found God through sin, but this ain't my confession
I'll wait on judgment day
It's lose or win, got no need for protection
Stand up or out of my way
God bless this mess, this mess is mine
Won't pound my chest or criticize
I must confess: I've lived, I've died
God bless this mess, this mess is mine
God bless this mess, this mess is mine
The howling doomsday dogs are snapping at your feet
'Round here the sky is cracked, but won't admit defeat
Down here they got your back and stood at your side
This treasure chest of rags still keeps this dream alive
God bless this mess, this mess is mine
Won't pound my chest or criticize
I must confess: I've lived, I've died
God bless this mess, this mess is mine
God bless this mess, this mess is mine

I think I'm goin' back
To the things
I learned so well
In my youth
I think I'm returning to
Those days
When I was young enough
To know the truth
Now there are no games
To only pass the time
No more eletric trains
No more trees to climb
But thinking young
And growing older
Is no sin
And I can play
The game of life to win
I can recall the time
When I wasn't ashamed
To reach out to a friend
And now I think I've got
A lot more than
Just my toys to lend
Now there's more to do
Then watch myself for cry
And everyday can be
My magic carpet ride
And I can play hide and seek with my fears
And live my days instead of counting my years
Let everyone debate the true reality
I'd rather see my world the way it used to be
A little bit of courage
All we lack
So catch me if you can
I'm goin' back

JBJ Demo Destination Anywhere
Time ain't no friend to me
Why did you have to leave me dry?
I ain't blind
Every time that we kiss
You left the taste on my lips
To remind me good ain't good enough
All the nights that we that we shared
I leave knowing you were there
Here's the scars that prove good ain't good enough
The sun don't shine on my face
The flowers died out on my firescape
The summer leaves don't want to fall
You put me down despite it all
Time ain't been good to me
Why did you have to make me cry?
Driving blind
Every time that we kiss
You left the taste on my lips
To remind me good ain't good enough
All those nights that we that we shared
I leave knowing you were there
Here's the scars that prove good ain't good enough
You said that you couldn't live without me
Then why can you live without me now?
When he holds you in his arms
And steals you with his charm
Every time that we kiss
You left the taste on my lips
To remind me good ain't good enough
All those nights that we that we shared
I leave knowing you were there
Here's the scars that prove good ain't good enough
Every time that we kiss
You left the taste on my lips
To remind me good ain't good enough
All those nights that we that we shared
I leave knowing you were there
Here's the scars that prove good ain't good enough

Morning comes crashing like a rock through a window
Jackhammer banging on the hot concrete
Take your stand
Move it, man!
It’s a backtalk, sidewalk symphony
Uber cars, yellow cabs, thick as smoke
Painted girls and [?]
Sax man blowin shootin’ through my veins
There’s a rhythm to the rocket that’s intoxicating
Goodnight New York, goodnight
Don’t ever close your eyes
If these streets could talk, New York, New York
So fine they named you twice
Your face, your brains
No other place
From east to west, these streets are blessed
Goodnight New York
Sleep tight New York
Goodnight
Starbucks, FedEx trucks on every street and avenue
Broadway lights, shining bright, make everybody beautiful
Walking on the high line, reaching for the sky line
If Alexander Hamilton could see it all
Garbage trucks backing up
Beep, beep, beep
Dogs barking on the balcony
The kids can’t sleep
Scaffolds??, potholes, bagman’s on a bicycle
Fast trains, bus, planes
Welcome to the carnival
Goodnight New York, goodnight
Don’t ever close your eyes
If these streets could talk, New York, New York
So fine they named you twice
Your face, your brains
No other place
From east to west, these streets are blessed
Goodnight New York
Sleep tight New York
Goodnight
The bravest and the finest
My hand’s on my heart for you
To the ones who paid the price
And to those who saw us through
It’s late, I’m getting weary
So, for now, I’ll say
Goodnight New York, goodnight
Don’t ever close your eyes
If these streets could talk, New York, New York
So fine they named you twice
Goodnight New York, goodnight
Don’t ever close your eyes
If these streets could talk, New York, New York
So fine they named you twice
Your face, your brains
No other place
From east to west, these streets are blessed
Goodnight New York
Sleep tight New York
Goodnight
Ah, goodnight, New York
Sleep tight, New York
Goodnight
So goodnight, New York
Sleep tight, New York
Goodnight

Growin' up the hard way,
we're growin' up the hard way.
She's got a blue tattoo on the back of her hand,
That says I love you, from the boys in the band.
She's been livin' on the run for almost a year,
Her daddy would abuse her, she's been livin' in fear.
She's got a diamond in her teeth and a leather beret,
She knows every city street from New York to LA.
Shes got little girl eyes
and her heart's made of stone,
I guess you gotta grow up fast
when you're out on your own.
Try, to hold your head up high,
you live and then you die,
Can someone tell me why?
Growin' up the hard way, learnin' how to live with the pain,
The weight of the world on your shoulders,
I guess that's just the price that you pay.
Growin' up the hard way, it's gettin' harder every day,
Lying in a bed made of fire,
Praying to God for some rain.
Growin' up the hard way.
He was the pride and joy of his family,
He always was the good boy they told him he'd be.
But no one knew the anger that was buildin' up inside,
He was drinking from the bottle,
that his old man used to hide.
He stole a rented car off route 35,
And when he gunned it I heard him scream
'Straight to hell I'm gonna drive'.
Cops came out of nowhere
and that truck got in his way,
I'm sorry Mrs Johnson that it had to end this way.
Try, to hold your head up high,
you live and then you die,
Can someone tell me why?
Growin' up the hard way, learning how to live with the pain,
The weight of the world on your shoulders,
I guess that's just the price that you pay.
Growin' up the hard way, it's gettin' harder every day,
Lying in a bed made of fire,
Praying to God for some rain.
Growin' up the hard way, Growin' up the hard way.
Growin' up the hard way, Growin' up the hard way.
Try, to hold your head up high.
Growin' up the hard way, learning how to live with the pain,
The weight of the world on your shoulders,
I guess that's just the price that you pay.
Growin' up the hard way, it's gettin' harder everyday,
Lying in a bed made of fire,
Praying to God for some rain.
Growin' up the hard way, Growin' up the hard way.
I'm growin' up the hard way,
Growin' up the hard way baby.
Growin' up the hard way.

In the heat of the street of the city
A young boy hides the pain
And he walks so tall, trying to hang on
But he knows he's going down again
I know he's going down...
Darkness fades he's the prince of his city
In a place where they all know your name
You can see in their eyes life so paralyzed.
Your just a pawn in a losin' game
You lose at life it ain't no game
Hear their cries
The hardest part is the night
(In the night, hear their cries, in the night)
Stay alive
The hardest part is the night, it's the night, it's the night...
All alone in a place where the lonely
They all have to walk through the rain
And they dance on the edge where you only
Only pray that it has to end
That the night ain't no friend
Hear their cries
The hardest part is the night
(In the night, hear their cries, in the night)
Stay alive
The hardest part is the night, it's the night, it's the night...
(x2)
These four walls they could tell you some stories
About lying and dying and fame
There's a price that you pay for the glory
About losing and choosing and pain
Hear their cries
The hardest part is the night
In the night, hear their cries, in the night
Stay alive
In the night, stay alive, in the night

Here we are as in olden days,
Happy golden days of yore.
Faithful friends who are dear to us
Gather near to us once more.
Through the years
We all will be together,
If the Fates allow
Hang a shining star upon the highest bough.
And have yourself A merry little Christmas now.

When the road gets dark
And you can no longer see
Let my love throw a spark
Have a little faith in me
And when the tears you cry
Are all you can believe
Give these loving arms a try baby
Have a little faith in me
Have a little faith in me
Have a little faith in me
Have a little faith in me
Have a little faith in me
When your secret heart
Cannot speak so easily
From a whisper start
To have a little faith in me
And when your back's against the wall
Just turn around and you will see
I will catch your fall
Have a little faith in me
Have a little faith in me
Have a little faith in me
Have a little faith in me
Have a little faith in me

And you can no longer see
Let my love throw a spark

Have a little faith in me
Have a little faith in me
I've been loving you for such a long time
Expecting nothing in return
Just for you to have a little faith in me
You know time, time is our friend
I will hold you up, I will hold you up
Your love gives me strength enough
Have a little faith in me

I've been hell raised on leather
Five years stood in black boots
Had anything any man could have wanted
All I ever wanted was you
Baby I've done whatever I wanted
I stole the lights and I've had command
Of the world and of the angels
They're both sold on a single hand
And I, I'm head over heels for you
And I have to say that it's true
I'm head over heels for you
I know you've seen all those romantic movies
How the hero comes to take you away
Then you wake up and you're all alone
Now that's all gonna change today
Remember bein' all alone
Remember cryin' on a rainy day
It don't have to be that bad now
It doesn't have to be that way
And I know what it's like baby to fall in love
Because I've fallen in love with you
It's true, yeah it's true
And I, I'm head over heels for you
And I have to say that it's true
I'm head over heels for you
And I know what it's like baby to fall in love

My daddy said he,
he came here to love this land
And like my daddy, I was raised to love this land
Hard working people son to son
and doing the best that they can
They came here only hearts in hand
A feat that any honest man could understand
You can hear the voices calling
In the heart of America
Can you hear the voices calling
In the Heart of America
When I was a young boy
I swore I'd try to fill his shoes
When you're born with nothing,
you aint got nothing left to lose
But you gotta listen people,
cause we're got something yeah
Were in the heart of America
With your back against the wall,
there aint no relief in sight
Like soldiers we can take it,
well, make it through the cold dark night
You can hear the voices calling
In the heart of America
Can you hear the voices calling
In the Heart of America
You can hear the voices calling
In the heart of America
And all the people theyre singing
sha la la la la sha la la la
In the heart of America
Sha la la la la sha la la la
In the heart of America
And I hope that someday,
that I might live to have a son
And I would teach him all the things
That his daddys daddy had done
But when that someday comes
Will you tell your son about the
Heart of America
Of America
You can hear the voices calling
In the heart of America
Can you hear the voices calling
In the Heart of America
Can you hear the voices calling
In the heart of America
Everybodys singing sha la la la
Sha la la la la sha la la la

So now you want to change sides
You say the lesson's been learned
I can tell by your voice
Baby just got burned
I can see in your eyes,
I can read it so well
You're a master a disguise
But it ain't hard to tell
Anyone that's been through it before
Knows that look
I can read your mind like a story book
And there's no happy ending to this life
Cause I can see the heartbreak in your eyes
I can feel the pain that you cry
Deep inside of those heartbreak eyes
You hear them cry through the night
Callin' over and over again
The voices came and took advantage
Now you don't wanna play
When the word got around
He gave your secrets away
Now it's too late to cry
You know the damage is done
Dry your tears say goodbye
You know he wasn't the one
All your life you been livin' out of love
Now you've folded your cards
When push came to shove
You're just another number
Just a victim of love's lies
I can see the heartbreak in your eyes
I can feel the pain that you cry
Deep inside of those heartbreak eyes
You hear me cry through the night
Callin' over and over again
Over and over again
You hear them cry through the night
Callin' over and over...
I can see the heartbreak in your eyes
I can feel the pain that you cry
Deep inside of your heartbreak eyes
You hear them cry through the night
Callin' over and over, those heartbreak eyes
I can feel the pain that you hide deep inside
Deep inside of those heartbreak eyes
You hear the cries through the night
Callin' over and over those heartbreak eyes
I can feel the hurt inside, your heartbreak eyes
I can hear the cries at night
Over and over again

I was caught in the crossfire of a silent scream
Where one man's nightmare is another man's dream
Pull the cover up high
And pray for the mornin' light
Cause you're livin' alone
In the heat of the night
Met a man with a message from the other side
Couldn't take the pressure
Had to leave it behind
He said it's up to you
You can run or you can fight (ya that's right)
Better leave it alone
In the heat of the night
In the heat of the night they'll be comin' around
There'll be lookin' for answers they'll be chasin' you down
In the heat of the night
(Where ya gonna hide when it all comes down)
(Don't look back don't ever turn around)
Had to pay the piper to call the tune
Said he'd be back someday
Said he'd be back real soon
Pull the shades down low
You'll know when the time is right
When you're lyin' alone in the heat of the night

Heaven help the white man if he turns his back away,
Heaven help the man who kicks the man who has to crawl,
Heaven help us all.

Heaven help us, Lord, hear our call when we call
Oh, yeah!
Heaven help the boy who won't reach twenty-one,

And the mighty from the small,
Heaven help us all.
Oh, oh, oh, yeah!

And you - you will be my queen
I I wish you could swim
Like dolphins - like dolphins can swim
Though nothing will keep us together
We can beat them - forever and ever
We can be heroes - just for one day
I - I will be king
And you - you will be queen
Though nothing will drive them away
We can beat them - just for one day
We can be heroes - just for one day
I - I can remember (remember)
Standing - by the wall (by the wall)
And the guns - shot above our heads (our heads)
And we kissed - as though nothing could fall (nothing could fall)
And the shame - was on the other side
Oh we can beat them - forever and ever

Living easy, livin' free
Season ticket, on a one,way ride
Asking nothing, leave me be
Taking everything in my stride
Don't need reason, don't need rhyme
Ain't nothing I would rather do
Going down, party time
My friends are gonna be there too
I'm on the highway to hell
On the highway to hell
Highway to hell
I'm on the highway to hell
No stop signs, speedin' limit
Nobody's gonna slow me down
Like a wheel, gonna spin it
Nobody's gonna mess me 'round
Hey satan! Paid my dues
Playin' in a rockin' band
Hey mama! Look at me
I'm on my way to the promise land. Wow!
I'm on the highway to hell
Highway to hell
On the highway to hell
I'm on the highway to hell
Don't stop me
I'm on the highway to hell
I'm on the highway to hell
I'm on the highway to hell
On the highway to hell
Highway to hell
I'm on the highway to hell
On highway to hell
I'm on the highway to hell
And I'm going down all the way
I'm on the highway to hell

I've always been a dreamer, lived in fantasies
Brought to my mind the bitter memories
Of days we spent together
They seem so long ago
Why'd you have to leave me
Why'd you let me go
We're used to chasin' rainbows
But they've been hard to find
My baby used to love me
Fame left it all behind
Now I've become a prisioner
I live behind four walls
You say I got life easy
But I got no life at all
There's no hidin' in the day
Cause they know who I am
I've been to the top, a lonely man
Those hot lights, Hollywood dreams
Can't bring back the love that you gave to me
Headlines, stars in their eyes
I lost you, chasin' those Hollywood dreams
Smile for the cameras, is all they ever say
Transmitting my emotions a thousand miles away
They chase me to the streets, callin' out my name
I'm comin' home to you
This life is drivin' me insane
Climbin' up the stairs, knockin on the door
But she don't recognise me
Or want me anymore
Those hot lights, Hollywood dreams
Can't bring back the love that you gave to me
Headlines, stars in their eyes
I lost you, chasin' those Hollywood Dreams
Those hot lights, Hollywood dreams
Can't bring back the love that you gave to me
Headlines, star in their eyes
I lost you, chasin' those Hollywood.....
Hot lights
Spotlights
Can't bring back your love to me
Chasin' those Hollywood.....

When I was just a boy
The devil took my hand
Took me from my home
He made me a man
So, don't talk to me about sympathy now
Cause you can't dance if you
Take a chance on your rosary
I'm going down, down, down, down, down
On the homebound train
It's been a millions years
That I been gone
I been everywhere, now I'm heading home
Been a lot of girls, but
There's a woman I know
Said don't take no plane
Better take a train
Cause I like it real slow
All the way back home
On the homebound train
I'm going down, down, down, down, down
On the homebound train
Solo
I'm on my way
I'm heading home
To be with my baby
Where I belong
Coming down the tracks now
See, I done my time
I'm going back now
To that home of mine
Well, here I come baby
Here I come baby
Here I come baby
All the way back home
On that homebound train
I'm going down, down, down, down, down
On that homebound train

House of fire
House of fire, baby
Let's build a house of fire, baby
Not one of wood or stone
Walk through my door of desire, baby
Come on lets make it our home
Don't need no window to watch you, baby
Don't need no roof overhead
I don't need no key to unlock you, baby
I'll use my lovin' instead
I won't tire
Take me higher
Building a house of fire, baby
Building it with our love
We are building a house of fire
every time we touch
House of fire
House of fire
We don't need to pay rent now, baby
No landlord to throw us out
I want to play in your garden, baby
When you want it give me a shout
I won't tire
Take me higher
Building a house of fire, baby
Building it with our love
We are building a house of fire
every time we touch
We are building this house together, baby
Standing on solid ground
We are building a house of fire
that you can't tear down
Brick by brick the flames get higher
Build it strong with our desire
Building a house of fire, baby
Building it with our love
We are building a house of fire
every time we touch
We are building this house together, baby
Standing on solid ground
We are building a house of fire
that you can't tear down
Building a house of fire, baby
Building it with our love
We are building a house of fire

She says, "baby"
I love it when she calls me baby
She says, "It's 4 am, why don't you grab your shoes
Come on over and then maybe..."
She drives me crazy
You know she knows she drives me crazy
Well she says,"let's pretend there's beer, champagne
We'll beet out the pouring rain
And I'll let ya
Drive me crazy"
Well she don't talk about love
We don't tak about us
What we don't say with words,
We say when we touch.
Hush
Come wrap your arms around me
Hush
We don't have to talk tonight so
Hush
Now we got some better crush
We don't have to say to much
Write a book each time we touch
Hush
Said nothing
Sometimes so little said is something
There's ten things I could've said
But we don't waste time on that shit
So we rise above it
Well she don't talk about love
And we don't talk too much

Come wrap your arms around me

Come wrap your arms around me

We would take no prisioners
'cause there was nobody giving in
They came walking through my jungle
Met an angel about to sin
I heard a voice from inside of me
When the youth of america cried
Can you help me? hear me call
Chorus (repeat 2x)
I don't wanna fall (i don't wanna fall)
I don't wanna fall (i don't wanna fall)
To the fire
When you're a part of society
You know, the heart of our innocence dies
When we met with authority
I looked him right between the eyes
'cause all we had was your innocence
All we had was our hearts to try
To win the fight, you tell me...
Can you save me from it all?
Repeat chorus
'cause i don't wanna fall (i don't wanna fall)
Don't let me fall (i don't wanna fall)
To the fire
I don't wanna fall (i don't wanna fall)
I don't wanna fall (i don't wanna fall)
To the fire
Can you help me, hear me call
Can you save me from it all?
Repeat chorus
Don't let me fall (i don't wanna fall)
Oh, i don't wanna fall, baby
(i don't wanna fall, fire)
I ain't go down with you (i don't wanna fall)
Don't let me fall (i don't wanna fall, fire)
Don't let me fall now, now, now
Now, now, now
Now, baby (i don't wanna fall)
Don't let me fall (i don't wanna fall)...

Hello, baby, it's only me
I know you're tired, it's been a long hard week
I was thinking maybe if you ain't got no plans
I just wanna be your man
Tonight I wanna be your man
Know what you're thinking, that you've got your doubts
I'm the only one that knows what your dreams are about
If you say no then I will understand
I just wanna be your man
Tonight I wanna be your man
And all I want is to dream out loud
We used to think we had it all worked out
I know that you don't want to be alone
The streets outside are so damn cold
You still ever think of you and me as 'us'?
Or another thing we let die and turn to dust?
I wasn't there to clean the cuts
I want the one who got caught in the ruts
I was just thinking maybe if you got no plans
I...
I just wanna...
Tonight I wanna be your man

You didn't have to love me, like you did
But you didn't, but you did
And I thank you
You didn't have to squeeze me, like you did
But you didn't, but you did, and I thank you
If you took your love to someone else
I know what I meant to be the loving dare
You made me feel like I've never felt
Your kiss is so good, I got the holler for help
You didn't have to squeeze me, like you did
But you didn't, but you did, and I thank you
You didn't have to hold me, like you did
But you didn't, but you did, and I thank you
Now every day there's something new
You put your make-up and your mild perfume
You got me trying to do things, too
Just so that I can keep up with you
You didn't have to shake me, like you did
But you didn't, but you did, and I thank you
You didn't have to make me, like you did
But you didn't, but you did, and I thank you
All my life I've been short changed
Without your love it would be a crying shame
Now I know what love I'm looking for
When they say they're being turned on
I wanna thank you, thank you, thank you
Thank you, baby, thank you, thank you I got to say
You didn't have to love me, like you did
But you didn't, but you did, and I thank you
You didn't have to hold me, like you did
But you didn't, but you did, and I thank you
I wanna thank you, baby I wanna thank you, let me count theways
Let me thank you, baby, baby I've got something to say
Thank you baby
Let me count the ways, for the whole wide world to hear, ohyeah
Now thank you for paying for my cold beer
I wanna thank you for being here with me baby
Thank you for understanding why I was out so late last night
Thank you for giving me your best friend's phone number
Thank you for understanding, that me and your sister are justgood friends.

What time is it baby? Is it that time again?
When snow will be falling, friends will be calling
You know it's time when, there'll be carolers singing 'Silent Night'
I love when they sing, the feeling it brings
It's warm as a fire is bright
Soon there'll be toys for good girls and boys
And reindeer are heading our way
Yes, and Santa will come down the chimney above
There's one thing I wanted to say
(Chorus)
I wish every day could be like Christmas
And if I could have one wish come true
I wish every day could be, full of peace and harmony
I wish every day could be like Christmas, I do
I saw a child sit with old Mr. Clause,
Looked him in the eye and he asked old Santa what peace on earthwas
Now the old man grew cautious, on how he would say
That it's the greatest gift what you could give, every day
I wish every day could be like Christmas
And if I could have one wish come true
I wish every day could be, full of peace and harmony
I wish every day could be like Christmas, I do
Now the mistle-toes and the house of Lords
All the world seems at ease tonight
And all that I ask when these precious moments pass
Is why can't every day be so bright
I wish every day could be like Christmas
And if I could have one wish come true
I wish every day could be, full of peace and harmony
I wish every day could be like Christmas, I do
Honest I do, yes I do now
Very merry Christmas

When your heart is hungry
When you want a secret you can keep
You know that you can call me
Anytime for anything you need
No one asking questions
No need for alibis
No need for wasting words
I'm who I am
I'm your man
No job that I can't handle
There ain't much
That i ain't done
I'll be that one call that you get
When you can't call no one
When the room is dark and empty
There's no need to explain
Baby I’ll come running here I am
I'm your man
We know not to ask questions
So no one has to lie
We both know without hello
There won't be no goodbyes
No promise that we won't keep
No more to understand
Tonight you're my woman and i'm your man
I'm your man
We both know we're lonely
When we hold each other tight
But we won't ask forgiveness
When we walk away at night
No one asking questions
No need for alibis
No need to say those words
Just take my hand
I'm your man

Ridin' down the highway
Goin' to a show
Stop in all the byways
Playin' rock 'n' roll
Gettin' robbed
Gettin' stoned
Gettin' beat up
Broken boned
Gettin' had
Gettin' took
I tell you folks
It's harder than it looks
It's a long way to the top
If you wanna rock 'n' roll
It's a long way to the top
If you wanna rock 'n' roll
If you think it's easy doin' one night stands
Try playin' in a rock roll band
It's a long way to the top if you wanna rock 'n' roll
Hotel, motel
Make you wanna cry
Lady do the hard sell
Know the reason why
Gettin' old
Gettin' grey
Gettin' ripped off
Under-paid
Gettin' sold
Second hand
That's how it goes
Playin' in a band
It's a long way to the top
If you wanna rock 'n' roll
It's a long way to the top
If you wanna rock 'n' roll
If you wanna be a star of stage and screen
Look out it's rough and mean
It's a long way to the top
If you wanna rock 'n' roll
It's a long way to the top
If you wanna rock 'n' roll
It's a long way to the top
If you wanna rock 'n' roll
It's a long way to the top
If you wanna rock 'n' roll
Well it's a long way
It's a long way, you should've told me
It's a long way, such a long way

Tonight there's gonna be a jailbreak
Somewhere in this town
See me and the boys we don't like it
So were getting up and going down
Hiding low looking right to left
If you see us coming I think it's best
To move away do you hear what I say
From under my breath
Tonight there's gonna be a jailbreak
Somewhere in the town
Tonight there's gonna be a jailbreak
So don't you be around
Don't you be around
Tonight there's gonna be trouble
Some of us won't survive
See the boys and me mean business
Bustin' out dead or alive
I can hear the hound dogs on my trail
All hell breaks loose, alarm and sirens wail
Like the game if you lose
Go to jail
Tonight there's gonna be a jailbreak
Somewhere in the town
Tonight there's gonna be a jailbreak
So don't you be around
Tonight there's gonna trouble
I'm gonna find myself in
Tonight there's gonna be trouble
So woman stay with a friend
You know it's safer
Breakout!
Tonight there's gonna be a breakout
Into the city zones
Don't you dare to try and stop us
No one could for long
Searchlight on my trail
Tonight's the night all systems fail
Hey you good lookin' female
Come here!
Tonight there's gonna be a jailbreak
Somewhere in the town
Tonight there's gonna be a jailbreak
So don't you be around
Tonight there's gonna be trouble
I'm gonna find myself in
Tonight there's gonna be trouble
So woman stay with a friend

Sitting here just watching you sleep
Wish I could slip inside and be
In some technicolor dream
But the air's too thick for one of us to breathe
I'm not fool enough to think
You couldn't live life without me
I didn't come this far to throw the towel in
I didn't fight this hard to walk away
If I ain't smart enough to say I'm sorry
It's just because the words got in the way
I remember how it used to be
I was you and you were me
We were more than just the same
Now these shoes don't fit, my skin's too tight
When you want a kiss, I take a bite
Let your heart call up the cops, read me my rights
Last night I drank enough to drown
Raise a toast to your good looks and to my health
Look, we both know how much I've let you down
Janie don't you take your love to town
Janie, don't you take your love to town
Janie, don't you take your love to town
If I've got to beg, I'll beg, just don't walk away
Janie, don't you take your love to town
You deserve a shooter, a saint
Someone to give it to you straight
To find the soul throught flesh and bone
My life's a treasure, full of sunny weather
But it's left me feeling cold
Now all you want to do is take me home
I hated you, the night you said you loved me
I hated you, 'cause I couldn't love myself
I'm begging you now, baby, please, just hold me
I got one foot in, one foot off the ground
Janie, don't you take your love to town
Janie, don't you take your love to town
If I've got to beg, I'll beg, just don't walk away
Janie, don't you take your love to town
Sitting here while you're fast asleep
In the bathroom by the sink
Trying to write the right words down
I turn out the lights, close my eyes
There ain't no prayers or kiss goodnight
What I'll forget to say tomorrow, I'll say now
Janie, don't you take your love to town
Janie, don't you take your love to town
Janie, don't you take your love to town
If I've got to beg, I'll beg, just don't walk away
Janie, don't you take your love to town

You take and you take without giving
Like the ride is never going to end
You think you know who's going to Heaven
Well I know I'm going to see you again
On Judgement day
Others, they walk the bad road
If you do you better watch what you say
You think that you can hide in your shadow
But it's your shadow gonna ruin your way
On Judgement day
You walk through the fire, no where to run to, no one to blame
Cause hey, hey, hey
Winners and losers, sinners and users, will all have to pay
On Judgement day
Some people they call me brother
Some people they say that they care
Some people they steal from the Heavens above
It's going to be a cross to bear
On Judgement day
You walk through the fire
With nowhere to run to, no one to blame
Well hey, hey, hey
Winners and losers, sinners and users, will all have to pay
On Judgement day
It's just you and me
I won't fade away
Let's face up to the truth
It's our own Judgement day
On Judgement day
You walk through the fire
Nowhere to run to, no one to blame
Hey, hey, hey
Winners and losers, sinners and users, will all have to pay

I got miles of trouble spreadin' far and wide
Bills on the table gettin' higher and higher
They just keep on comin', there ain't no end in sight
I'm just holdin' on tight
I got someone who loves me more than words can say
And I'm thankful for that each and every day
And if I count all my blessings, I get a smile on my face
Still it's hard to find faith
Refrão:
But if you can look in my eyes
And tell me we'll be alright
If you promise never to leave
You just might make me believe
It's just day to day tryin' to make ends meet
What I'd give for an address out on Easy Street
I need a deep margarita to help me unwind
Leave my troubles behind
Repete refrão
I used to believe in us when times got tough
But lately I'm afraid that even love is not enough
But if you can look in my eyes
And tell me we'll be alright
If you promise never to leave
You just might make me
Oh you just make me
You just might make me believe

Hey mister can you help me
I'm a loner on the run
I'm just looking for tomorrow
And i ain't gonna hurt no one
I jumped headfirst into a bottle
I was looking for a friend
Came up just short of nothing
I didn't find the truth i only found an end
So tell me who's gonna save me
Or my father or my son
When the only justice a man can see
Is the barrel of a loaded gun
I been broke and i've been hungry
I think they're both my middle name
But i don't never ever never seem to get enough
Still guess i can't complain
'cause what you get in life you take it
You've gotta hold on and make it last
They say good things come to those who wait
But it's life that goes so fast
And when there's just one rule you live by
Each day you kiss the rising sun
When you live and die by the life we breathe
In the barrel of a loaded...
Guns talk to me in my sleep at night
And a gun somewhere is burning
With my name
Winners are losers and losers
Will have to face
All those yesterdays
And all of the dreams they blew away
So mister can you help me
Or are you my gun
Have the ghosts of justice
Brought you here to me to taste
The barrel of a loaded gun
There's justice in the barrel
Of a loaded gun

Listen people can't you hear the voices that are crying out.
There's a hunger burning in the heart of their souls.
Maybe now that I got you let me tell you what I'm talking 'bout
Stand up and shout tonight we'll lose control
I been down and mistreated
Now we're standing undefeated.
I'm the King of the Mountain
I'm the King of the Hill
I'm the King of the Mountain
I'm the King of the Hill
You spend your life working 9 to 5 it's like doing time
Boss man says "Hey boy, you'll never be no good"
With the night there's a magic in the air that makes us comealive
Tonight's the night they can't put you down, no one could.

I was walking on a wire
Looking down, there was no net
Now, I'm standing at your door
Me and my last cigarette
Yeah we've been through this before
Too late to cover up my tracks
Damn the fool who begs for more
I'll take my past and paint it black
Now this circus has left town
This clown has got to get his feet back on the ground
*
I'm learning how to fall
Learning how to take a hit
Had to walk before I crawled
It was winner take it all
Now I'm learning how to fall
Yeah, I got the hang of it
I was standing in the light
There were faces all around
I put my gloves up for a fight
One sucker punch and I was down
* Repeat
I was flying through the clouds
Pucker up, it's time to kiss the ground
* Repeat

When I look in your eyes I can feel the fire
A see through disguise can't conceal desire
I've been readin your lips, they don't need no translation
They want more than a kiss, I come to make my donation
So turn out the lights, I'm going down slowly
Don't tell me what's right, just tell me you want me
Tell me you want me
Just tell me you want me, want me, want me
Let's make it baby
Let's make it baby
Let's make it baby
Let's make it baby
Come, come, come a little bit closer
I want to play doctor
It keeps getting harder, harder, harder to keep me away
I want to taste the sweat that's runnin' off of your body
Get the sheets all wet, I wanna make you feel naughty
Let's make it baby
Let's make it baby
Let's make it baby
Let's make it baby
Turn out the lights
Don't tell me you love me
Just tell me you want me
Don't tell me you love me

I'll be there to hold you by the hand
When you need someone to walk you home
You know that I'll be there to understand
When you call me on the phone
I'll be there to watch you when you sleep
When you close your eyes at night
And I'll be there to keep your secrets kept,
Cross my heart, hope to die
I swear each word is true
There's only one thing I wouldn't do
I'll be there when you need a real friend
I'll be there to listen to your secrets
I'll be there and give you all I've got
I'll be there when you paint your masterpiece
And I'll be right beside your every move
I'll give you my eyes so you can see
And I'll help you to find the things you've lost
When you're busting at the seams
I swear each word is true
There's only one thing I wouldn't do
I ain't gonna love you
I ain't gonna love you
Chorus:
Nobody wants you like I want you
Nobody needs you like I need you
You know I would beg and plead, get down on my knees
I'd do most anything, it's true
But I ain't gonna love you
I ain't gonna love you
'Cause I love you
I'll be there to love the things you love
I'll be the one who knows your middle name
Be the only one that you can trust
I'll give you the blood that's in my veins
I swear these words are true
There's only one thing I wouldn't do
I ain't gonna love you
Chorus:
'Cause nobody wants you like I want you
Nobody needs you like I need you
You know I would beg and please, get down on my knees
Do most anything for you
But I ain't gonna love you
I ain't gonna love
'Cause I love you
Because I love you

Needed a car, looked around for a week
For two dollars down I signed my name on the lease
There was a knock on my door, old man wants his keys
All he said was something about bankruptcy
Oh no, here we go
There ain't no day that's different from the day you know that
Life's too short for days like these
Wish I could close my eyes and just go back to sleep
It's hard to keep running when you're down on your knees
Life's too short for days like these
Minding my own business in some restaurant
Trying to get some dinner but then guess what?
Some chick got there I slept with, throws her drink in my face
And then her ugly brother kicked my ass all over the place
Oh no, here we go
Ain't no day that's different from the day you know that
Life's too short for days like these
Wish I close my eyes and just go back to sleep
It's hard to keep running when you're down on your knees
Life's too short for days like these
I met her last night at quarter to three
I couldn't believe that she came home with me
Woke up this morning scratching now I know when to leave
They say you lay down with dogs, gonna wake up with fleas
You know that life's too short for days like these
Wish I could close my eyes and just go back to sleep
It's hard to keep running when you're down on your knees
Life's too short for days…
Life's too short for days like these
Baby, baby, don't you know it's trick or treat
I'd get up and dance if I could get on my feet
Life's too short for days…
Life's too short for days…
Life's too short for days like these
Life's too short for days like these
Wish I could close my eyes and just go back to sleep
It's hard to keep running when you're down on your knees
Cause life's too short for days…
Baby, life's too short for days
Life's too short for days like these

I got my call light on
Gimme one more fare tonight
Just get me over the bridge
I can see those shiny bay lights
You know I'm never alone
But I'm feeling lonely tonight
Damn, I got my last cigarette
But I ain't got not light
God let these wheels roll
To where the girls are pretty
When the nights explode
And life is still living
Down this open road
The arms of pity
Wait to greet me tonight in little city
In my rear view mirror
I see someone else's hairline
I hear that fire in your eyes
Is on the rock and doing hard time
And the grapes of wrath, they're on the vine
There's wine in this dirt
Here love ain't love
It's just another four letter word
God let these wheels roll
To where the girls are pretty
When the nights explode
And life is still living
Down this open road
The arms of pity
Wait to greet me tonight in little city
Now that cold gray fog's
Just a rolling down the highway
He's come to carry me home
It's put a little smile on my face

Marry me to the blue sky
Bury me in that long last drop of hard rain
Meet me where they stop time
That's you to me on the shovel that's digging this grave
Till I can waltz on a moonbeam
Till I can find a way to turn all tears into wine
I'll hitch my ride to a day dream
Can't unkiss the lips that love is leaving behind
I ain't living with the ghost
No future living in the past
I've seen what hate has done to hope
Tomorrow wasn't built to last
I ain't living with the ghost
How can I scream I'm scared to breathe
I wrote each word you gave the toast
But we were fire and gasoline
I ain't living with the ghost
I set my sails over wheat fields
Rode waves of amber let a new sun shine on my face
I dropped the sword put down my shield
I left your scars for the stars
Guiding my way
I traded hurting for healing
I must admit that I was reeling
Now I'm feeling just fine
Traded nightmares for dreaming
Go tell your shadows
That I got out alive
I ain't living with the ghost
No future living in the past
I've seen what hate has done to hope
I found the tree, I cut the rope
Tomorrow wasn't built to last
I ain't living with the ghost
How can I scream I'm scared to breathe
I wrote each word you gave the toast
But we were fire and gasoline
I ain't living with the ghost
Last night I had this dream
I saw a man wash his feet
In the church holy water
He worked up to his knees
From his arms to his neck
Said I'm over my head
He was crying trying to get some relief
Lord, I'm just trying to get some relief
I had this dream
That man was me
I ain't living with the ghost
No future living in the past
I've seen what hate has done to hope
I found the tree, I cut the rope
Tomorrow wasn't built to last
I ain't living with the ghost
How can I scream I'm scared to breathe
I wrote each word you gave the toast
But we were fire and gasoline
Now I ain’t living with the ghost

I need someone, I need somebody to be a friend,
I'm not alone, but still I'm lonely in the end
She was runnin' away on the 9 o'clock train, so very far from home,
With a head full of schemes, a handful of dreams
I was on my own
I know you're out there, I know you're there
Lonely, lonely is the night
Lonely, lonely is the night
What can I do, what can I say, to get her back,
Alone I wait before my train comes runnin' down the tracks
Heaven knows that I'd wait if God were to say that you would come
I guess you can say it's the price that you pay for holdin' on
I know you're out there, I know you're there
Lonely, lonely is the night
Lonely, lonely is the night
Lonely, lonely is the night
Lonely, lonely is the night
If you want me, if you need me, I'll be there,
If you want me, please believe me, I'll be waiting
I know you're out there, I know you're there
Lonely, lonely is the night
Lonely, lonely is the night
Lonely, lonely is the night
Lonely, lonely is the night

Love hurts, Love scars
Love wounds and harms
Any heart
Not tough or strong enough
To take a lot of pain, take a lot of pain
Love is like a cloud, holds a lot of rain
Love hurts, ooeee-ooeee, Love hurts
'Cause I'm young, I know
But even so
I know a thing or two, that I've learned from you
Really learned a lot, really taught me a lot
Love is like a flame, it burns yourself when it's hot
Love hurts, ooeee-ooeee, Love hurts
Some fools think of happiness, blissfulness, togetherness
Some fools fool themselves, I guess
They ain't foolin' me
I know it isn't true, I know it isn't true
Love is like a flame, makes your heart so blue
Love hurts, ooeee-ooeee, Love hurts
I really learned a lot, really learned a lot
Love is like a flame, it burns you when it's hot
Love hurts, ooeee-ooeee yes, Love hurts
ooeee-ooeee yes, Love hurts
Love hurts
Na na na na na yeah
Love hurts
Na na na na na yeah
Love hurts
Na na na na na yeah
Love hurts

Load your guns, take sides
Raise your flag, 'cause baby, love is war
Hey baby, what ever happened to the girl next door
If I remember, she looked a lot like you
Whatever happened to the boy who said, "I'd die for you"
We're hangin' on, but love is gone and now it's war
You got your weapons, baby I got mine
You tried to trap me with your bedroom eyes
Under the covers, 'cross the enemy lines
When you don't know, you just say no.
Tell me why, love is war
When the battle is done you still want more
Every broken heart is tryin' to even the score
It's the way of the world, love is war
Where boy meets girl, love is war
Oh I remember when the love was good and the bed was hot
But now we sleep on separate sides and the sheets are cold
Aw, I used to love your candy baby, now the store is closed
I know my silence tears you up inside
You built a fortress for your hurt to hide
You think you've won, but it's a tie
'Cause nobody wins a war of pride
Tell me why, love is war
When the battle is done you still want more
Every broken heart is tryin' to even the score
It's the way of the world, love is war
Where boy meets girl, love is war
Tell me why, love is war
What the hell are we fighting for
Tell me why love is war
When the battle is done you still want more
Every broken heart is trying to even the score
It's the way of the world, love is war
Tell me why love is war
When the battle is done you still want more
Every broken heart is trying to even up the score
It's the way of the world, love is war
War, love is war, war, love is war
War, love is war, war, love is war

I was lost, then I found you
I never thought it would be this way
Showed you my heart, I left it unguarded
Like a thief in the night you stole it away
Now you're gone, the pain goes on and on
I still hear you whispering to me
Through the shadows of the night
Love lies, you're just a victim of the headlines
You're running on into a cold night
You're just a number of the love lies
All alone you call it survival
He lost at love to a stranger's lines
Walking the streets, searching with vengeance
For a face that he dreams of night after night
Time goes on, all signs of life stolen
Simple dreams were allbroken
Best of times become desperation
But how many tears must you cry to survive
Love lies, you're just a victim of the headlines
You're running on into a cold night
Just a number to the love lies
Love lies, you're just another victim of the headlines
You're running on into a cold night
Just a number to the love lies
They met late one night in the city
Both men knew only one would stay
Scratched a picture of a heart on a bullet
And took his life away
Love lies, you're just another victim of the headlines
You're running on into a cold night
Just a number of the love lies
Love lies, you're just a victim of the headlines
You're running on into a cold night
Just a number of the love lies

BOUNCE B-side
She counts the days away and waits for valentines
She says every girl in the past is just a waste of time
You know, whoa
She don't believe in miracles and make-believe
If you were blind you still could see
That she believes in me, Ohhhh
Feels like I found a pocket full of gold
I'm lucky baby
So lucky baby
Lucky to be with you today
Lucky to be the one to say "I'm lucky baby"
So lucky baby
Whenever I see your smiling face
Lucky to be the one to be lucky
Now all of heaven's angels have to wear their wings
She likes cheap sunglasses and diamond rings
You know, ohhh
She brings sunshine to a cloudy day
When we walk on by people stop and say
I'm lucky baby
So lucky baby
Lucky to be with you today
Lucky to be the one to say "I'm lucky baby"
So lucky baby
Whenever I see your smiling face
Lucky to be the one to be lucky
I'm lucky baby
So lucky baby
Lucky to be with you today
Lucky to be the one to say "I'm lucky baby"
I'm lucky baby
I got lucky when you found me
It only took one kiss to see
What did I do to get to be so lucky baby?
I'm lucky baby
Lucky baby
Lucky baby
I'm lucky baby
So lucky baby
Lucky to be with you today
Lucky to be the one to say "I'm lucky baby"
I'm lucky baby
Whenever I see your smiling face
Lucky to be the one to be lucky

Sabes mi nombre y me crees conocer
Tu me miras pero se que ya no me ves
Tu me quieres solo porque yo te quiero a ti
No te importa, niegas la verdad hasta el fin
Y necesitas que alguien se quede aqui
Me condenas a sufrir
Miro a tu ventana, no entiendo que pasó
Hay silencio en la ciudad, la luna se escondió
Seguire vagando sin que sepa el corazón
Por que miro a tu ventana y no entiendo que pasó
Te deseaba pero amanecimos llorando
Dos extraños sin poder salvar la ilusion
Ya es tarde, lo nuestro se quedo en el ayer
Nunca pensé que fuera a perder
Miro a tu ventana, no entiendo que pasó
Hay silencio en la ciudad, la luna se escondió
Seguire vagando sin que sepa el corazón
Por que miro a tu ventana
El amor te ciega si te dejas engañar
Inventas un motivo para continuar
Dicen que el que espera gana en el amor
Miro a tu ventana, no entiendo que pasó.
La noche escapa y se va tu amor
Con ella te lleva para siempre.
Miro a tu ventana, no entiendo que pasoó
Hay silencio en la ciudad, la luna se escondió
Cansado de hablar tanto, he perdido la razon
Por que miro a tu ventana y no entiendo que pasó

I used to live but now I survive
I used to believe but now it's just one day at a time
The circus is gone, it's all packed away
The clown's hat, the makeup's been packed in his case
So we wave goodbye to Miss Fourth of July
The queen of the roses has left us with nothing but thorns
Don't say we never tried, Miss Fourth of July
The stars that we reached for left us with nothing but dawn
I used to laugh but I've learned to cry
For I ain't too proud to let you see tears fall from these eyes
For all of my hopes, my heartaches and fears
For a night I just watched and you walked out of here
I just waved goodbye to Miss Fourth of July
The queen of the roses has left us with nothing but thorns
Don't say we never tried, Miss Fourth of July
The crown that we reached for left us with nothing
But your thorns left me wounded not unlike the truth
When innocence sang his last song
He'd tell me that it's all gone
Just look me in the eyes and say man, nothing at all
I used to live, now I've learned to die
And I used to dream… I used to dream…
So now we wave goodbye to Miss Fourth of July
The queen of the roses has left us with nothing but thorns
Don't say we've never tried, Miss Fourth of July
The stars that we reached for, they've left us with nothing but dawn
Oh, yeah…
Nothing but a heavy hit of heartbreak
A handful of blues..
Oh, yeah…

I always wanted what I couldn't have
I hoped and dreamed that maybe someday
That I'd find out what love was all about
I sure grew up tonight the hard way
Now the candy store's closed
The movie's sold out
The play's drifter isn't what it's all about
And now we're parting ways
I won't say a word
Let our broken hearts cry in their graves
Where theyou'll never be heard
It's more than we bargained for
Our love is the price we paid
And just like a faded dream
It's slippin' away
Last night I saw you out with my best friend
When I'm with you I see him in your eyes
I want to hold you but I don't understand
There's somethin' there that's so hard to disguise
Now tears run down your face
As you walk through the night
Those cold empty streets leave you
Wonderin' what's right
As you walk away with your broken heart
Don't you try to deny that your love had torn you apart
More than we bargained for
Our love is the price we paid
And just like a faded dream....
It's slippin' away
It's more than we bargained for
It's more than we bargained for
More than we bargained for
Our love is the price we paid
And just like a faded dream....
It's slippin' away
More than we bargained for
Our love is the price we paid
And just like a faded dream....
It's slippin' away

Heaven holds a place for those who pray

Heaven holds a place for those who pray

Hide it in a hiding place where no one ever goes
Put it in your pantry with your cupcakes
It's a little secret, just the Robinsons' affair
Most of all, you've got to hide it from the kids
Coo, coo, ca-choo, Mrs Robinson
Jesus loves you more than you will know (Wo, wo, wo)

Going to the candidates debate
Laugh about it, shout about it
When you've got to choose
Ev'ry way you look at it, you lose
Where have you gone, Joe DiMaggio

What's that you say, Mrs. Robinson
Joltin' Joe has left and gone away

My friend had a girlfriend
She liked her drink
Sucked the head off her lager
Threw me a wink
And she said to me "Buddy, what's your sign?"
I was off I was runnin'
Knocked me clean off my feet
Her tongue kept on selling
What any blind man could see
I just kept on stumbling through the stop signs
She said "What you hiding underneath that shirt?"
Right behind the buttons there's a heart that hurts
Adam's evening left the curse
Take it off make it work
Naked - Naked - Just get back to basics
Naked - Face it - You can't fake it when you're naked
Naked - Face it
All I'm saying
The tail you been chasing
Put the K back in kink
Threw a coin in her jukebox
I started to think
She just smiled and offered me a peace sign
How far you gonna run in those designer shoes
The soul with holes ain't gonna be the one you lose
I don't know which one is worse
Adam, me or you
Naked - Naked - Just get back to basics
Naked - Face it - You can't fake it when you're naked
Naked - Face it
All I'm saying
Take it, embrace it
Baby, here we are
Can't you almost... taste it
Naked - Naked - Just get back to basics
Naked - Face it - You can't fake it when you're
Naked - Naked - Naked - Naked

When I promised you,
That I would be strong,
It was not a lie,
It was just that I was wrong
There's no way I'd ever guess,
I'd be so defenseless
*
I have walked against the wind,
I find shelter in my friends,
There's some comfort in the wine,
If I can sleep it buys me time,
I can duck out of the rain,
But there's no hiding from the truth,
I'm still naked to the pain,
Of losing you
I can't build a door,
That you can't drift through,
When I close my eyes,
I still dream of you
Don't you know when you love someone,
There's no protection
* Repeat
I can duck out of the rain,
But there's no hiding from the truth,
But I'm still naked to the pain… of losing you.

You got your tin pans out in the alley
You got those imitation tiger skin shoes
You got the magazines talking about you too
You talk about the future of muscles
The kind that make you black and blue
You say that you're tough
I've had enough of you
And the cat says lately the mousetrap's blown a fuse
She's got her finger on the trigger, the gun's pointed right at you
Too much too soon, it's never enough, never enough
Too much too soon, it's never enough for you
Tell all the saints you hustle
That you were born to be a king
When you're on the town flashing phony diamond rings
You made a play for a girl in trouble
You swore you were a ladies man
If you wanna dance, you know you gotta pay the band
And the cat says lately, the mousetrap's blown a fuse
Say you'll win but baby you were born to lose
Too much too soon, it's never enough, never enough
Too much too soon, it's never enough for you
Too much too soon, it's never enough, never enough
Too much too soon, it's never enough for you
You had a high-class education
And a silver spoon stuck in your ass
An American Express could always make the party last
With a straw up your nose and a bitch in the Rolls
You took that turn a little fast
You took it to a wall, the chauffeur had a heart attack
The cat says lately the mousetrap's blown a fuse
They called Superman to save him
But there's nothing left that he could do
Too much too soon, it's never enough, never enough
Too much too soon, it's never enough
Too much too soon, it's never enough, never enough
Too much too soon, it's never enough
Too much too soon, it's never enough, never enough
Too much too soon, it's never enough

When she walks when she talks
She does it like you
The way she do everything,
she does it just like you
Lord knows that she moves so fine
Those precious lips came and blew my mind
But I can't love somebody new
No one does it like you
No one does it like you
Someone's taken my place,
Baby say it ain't true
All your friends say you love him,
Baby say it ain't true
I close my eyes and I see your face
Whole memories lost that I can't replace
Of all the crazy thingsthat we do
No one does it like you
No one does it like you
I was wrong I must have been crazy
Now I think I'm goin' out of my mind
These thoughts of you are driving me crazy
A girl like you is so hart to find
Repeat Verse 1
I try to find a girl to treat me right
I take a different one home every night
Bu no one makes my dreams come true
No one does it like you

Bless me father I have sinned,
I'm not sure where to begin.
I won't name names or where I've been,
But I've been there and back again
No hail marys will save me,
You learned to live with memories,
Here, slip this sinner up your sleeve,
Just stay inside until I leave.
I've been running, always running
Never have both feet on the floor
I've been running, always running,
Now I'm not runnning anymore...
The hands of time may tick no more
Let darkness fall upon this door
No waves will wash up on this shore
I won the fight but lost the war
I've been running, always running
Never had both feet on the floor
And I've been running, always running
Now I ain't running anymore.
There were roses I have loved
Who've given or have given up
I pushed your patience and my luck
It wasn't love I didn't trust
It wasn't you, or me, or us
You've shouldered ifs, and ands, and buts
It's that way ok, I've said too much
But I've been running, always running
Never had both feet on the floor
I've been running, always running
Now I ain't running anymore

You look like shit so dear my brother
I missed you too, yeah you dumb stupid mother
Jeep, welcome home sign, a bottle of red
At least you got freedom in an open out there
Free cheers till the best of the rest we got left
If you could dream anything, what would that be?
If you could dream back, would you share it with me?
We carry our choices, we hide our regrets
We know there's a price, we'll both pay our debts
But maybe they ain't seen the last of us yet
'Cause old habits die hard
Old habits die hard
It might be painful to smile
But it covers the scars
And old habits die hard
There's a face in the mirror, but it don't look like me
Yesterday's gone, a rain drop in the sea
I have your back for each day that's gone by
And I'll still have it till the day that I die
Yeah, I'll still have it till the day that I die
Old habits die hard
Old habits die hard
It might be painful to smile
But it covers the scars
And old habits die hard
Some day you'll be missed by those you leave behind
And I hope you touched other lives like you've touched mine
Old habits die hard
Old habits die hard
It might be painful to smile
But it covers the scars
Appearances change but don't change who we are
And old habits die hard.

Barkeep pour me one last shot 'cause I must be on my way
Gotta make that same old stop that this soul makes everyday
Tell me why am I holding on? Harry, why is love like a flame?
It burns you when it's hot but Cupid's fire trucks never came
I can't bend the hands of time so I think myself to sleep
The way you never said goodbye if only in my dreams
Refrão:
Tell me where you want to go
Tell what you long to be
Are you longing for my touch?
If only in my dreams
We sing the love songs you once sung
Touch the stars you want to reach
And I will see the job gets done
If only in my dreams
Lord, I'd sacrifice my eyes; there's nothing else I'd rather see
And you can have my heart; it's of little use to me
And if you want my soul I'd throw it in for free
It's all I'm worth that's left since my angel got her wings
Now I'm down and on my knees; it's of little use to pray
Unless you give her back but there's no deals cut these days
They're only in my dreams
Refrão
Now I curse the daytime
When I'm alone at nighttime
'Cause I swore the sun shined just for you
And I know you anywhere
There ain't no pain, there ain't no tears
And if I have my way from the moment I get there…
Take me where you wanna go
We'll be who you wanna be
All I needed was your touch
All I want is you and me
We'll sing the love songs you once sung
And you'll be in my dream
Until that war is won
It's only in my dreams

You say you've been used before
Whole lot of love then it's out the door
And you swore you'd be used again no more, no more
Then you got on your feet again
It came to you like a long lost friend
Now they say you're wearing a bulletproof heart
Well I'm wearing my heart on my sleeve
Baby believe that I would never hurt you
Baby believe, cause my love will not desert you
Baby believe you know you got me begging and crying
I'm down on my knees
Open your heart and baby love again
Cause I won't let them take your love from me
You know that I've been hurt too
It's just your heart turns black and blue
There ain't no use in talking about it
You know all there is to say
I wanna love you girl
I wanna show you my world
Stop hiding the key to your heart
Baby let me in, let me in
Can't you see, I'm a bandaged refugee
Can't you see, I need you girl to comfort me
Can't you see, oh, of all the tears that you cry
Close your eyes
Open your heart, and baby love again
Cause I won't let them take your love from me
Open your heart, and baby love again
I won't let them take your love from me
Can't you see, I'm a bandaged refugee
Can't you see, I need you girl to comfort me
Can't you see, oh, of all the tears that you cry
Close your eyes
Open your heart (I want to love you girl)
You made me love again (I want to show you my world)
I won't let them take your love from me
Open your heart (I want to love you girl)
And baby love again (I want to show you my world)
I won't let them take your love
I wont let them take your love
I won't let them take your love from me

Little Jimmy just bought high top sneakers
Wants to fly high like his heroes can
He's got the smile like Michael Jordan
In the schoolyard, Jimmy, he's the man
I'm sitting here watching his heart beating
He's ten feet tall, all five feet four of him
Come six o'clock working out his foul shot
Who we fooling, Mama's calling, she smiles and says
You and me, we're ordinary people
Living in our ordinary lives
We can be ordinary people
These are extraordinary times
She lives alone, got four kids through high school
She cleans houses and she takes in wash at night
You'd never know that she don't have much
Because she's rich with the things money can't buy
She don't need clothes, she don't want diamonds
Don't need a brand new car to drive in
What she's got is love and that's a lot
At least it's a good start
You and me, we're ordinary people
Living in our ordinary lives
We can be ordinary people
These are extraordinary times
Everybody want's to be somebody
Everybody wants to be someone
We only want to watch the game on Sunday
Sit back, catch a little buzz
Ain't nobody wants to be nobody
Everybody wants a little love
Everybody wants to be the hero
And ride into the setting sun
You and me, we're ordinary people
Living in our ordinary lives
We can be ordinary people
These are extraordinary times
And I've got dreams like ordinary people
I can see them when I close my eyes at night
Can't you see we're ordinary people
These are extraordinary times

One Heart one other
They met last summer
One move she started
Now they love this way
The pain of pleasure
lying together
You're at their mercy
As the telephone's ringing on
No one said there'd be nights like this
Risk your life for a stolen kiss
We live , we learn, we lie
For the price of love
We kiss then say goodbye
For the price of love
(2X)
Each move goes so slow
Until the doors close
No secret codes now
No words as baby goes down
One last dance then goodbye
Practicing his love lies
He runs to his wife
And your left holding the knife
You live your life to take that chance
When you're a master of
The art of romance
And you know you won't cross
that line
Until that last slow dance
We live, we learn, we lie
For the price of love
We kiss, then say goodbye
For the price of love
We live, we learn, we lie
For the price of love
Alone our lonely hearts would die
It's all a game
And the way that it's played
There's no time to wonder why
To catch you when you fall
Answer when you call
No one can hear you cry
(Solo)
We live, we learn, we lie
For the price of love
We kiss, then say goodbye
For the price of love

Said you'd be there like a heartbeat
Thought I'd be there 'til the end

I ain't here for love or money

First you love me then you hate me

Baby breath for me

Billy works too hard, trying to make ends meet
He's gotta pay his credit cards
Yeah he's been dealing with the odds that even Vegas can't beat
By six he's out of bed, she makes his coffee sweet
He grabs his boots & his coat, leaves a note that says I Love You
And runs to catch a bus down at the end of Market Street
Refrão:
It took some time to figure it out
He's a rich man living in a poor man's house
He might be down, but he ain't out
He's a rich man living in a poor man's house
Every night at home, feels like it's Christmas Eve
Gracie's got his dinner on the stove, Daddy's coming home
And they've got seven hungry children that are tugging on his sleeve
Refrão
Every night at five when work lets out
He's a rich man living in a poor man's house
He arrives at 9 as the work bell's ringing
Hits the grind but his heart is singing
Some men live for money
Some men live for work
But it's a real man, a richer man who knows what love's worth
Refrão
Every night at five when work lets out
He's a rich man living in a poor man's house
A rich man living in a poor man's house 5X

Penny for you thoughts now baby, tell me what you see
You know I want to play with you but this ain't hide and seek, with me, can't you see
I know your momma don't approve of what I'm thinkin' of
You gave me just a little piece but it just ain't enough
You say stop, I say go, I say yeah, you say no, no, no, no, no
I just can't wait, cause I do stop much too late and only you can save me now
You know I've been to heaven and the other side
We can share our dreams together, with the full moon high
We will remember the night forever, it's just you and I
River of love and the full moon high
Pretend I'm Valentino and you're the beauty queen
Pretend we're in some movie instead of faded jeans
You and me we're the same just believe there's so much more to see
Oh baby save me now
Oh I've been to heaven and the other side
We can share our dreams together, with the full moon high

Give up your vows, give up your vows
Save our city, save our city
Right now
Well, i woke up this morning, i got myself a beer
Well, i woke up this morning, and i got myself a beer
The future's uncertain, and the end is always near
Let it roll, baby, roll
Let it roll, baby, roll
Let it roll, baby, roll
Let it roll, all night long

There's colors on the street
Red, white and blue
People shufflin' their feet
People sleepin' in their shoes
But there's a warming sign on the road ahead
There's lot of people sayin' we'd better off dead
Don't feel like Satan, but I am to them
So I try to forget it, any way I can.
Keep on rockin' in the free world
Keep on rockin' in the free world
Keep on rockin' in the free world
Keep on rockin' in the free world
I see a woman in the night
With a baby in her hand
Under an old street light
Near a garbage can
Now she puts the kid away, and she's gone to get a hit
he hates her life and what she's done to it
There's one more kid that will never go to school
Never get to fall in love, never get to be cool
Keep on rockin' in the free world
Keep on rockin' in the free world
Keep on rockin' in the free world
Keep on rockin' in the free world
We got a thousand points of light
For the homeless man
We got a kinder, gentler,
Machine gun hand
We got department stores and toilet paper
Got styrofoam boxes for the ozone layer
Got a man of the people, says keep hope alive
Got fuel to burn, got roads to drive
Keep on rockin' in the free world
Keep on rockin' in the free world
Keep on rockin' in the free world
Keep on rockin' in the free world

Come on reindeers, you know your the mastermind
You better run run Rudolph, Santa's gettin' far behind!
Run run Rudolph, Santa's gotta make it to town!
If Santa makes 'em high tail it, we can take the freeway down
You gotta run run Rudolph, racin' like a merry-go-round
Said Santa to the child, "Hey boy, what have you been longing for?"
He said "All I want for Christmas is a rock n' roll electric guitar"
And then away went Rudolph racin' like a shooting star
You gotta run run Rudolph, Santa's gotta make it to town!
If Santa makes 'em high tail it, we can take the freeway down
Well run run Rudolph, racin' like a merry-go-round
Come on David, take it!!!
Well said Santa to the little girl "What is it that you wanna get?"
"A little baby doll that can cry, sleep, drink and wet"
Well away went Rudolph, racin' like a searing jet
You gotta run run Rudolph, Santa's gotta make it to town!
If Santa makes 'em high tail it, we can take the freeway down
Well run run Rudolph, racin' like a merry-go round
Run run Rudolph (X5)
Racin' like a merry-go round
Run run Rudolph (X5)

She was a little bit older
I was a little bit shy
But I knew how to kiss
Her lips with mine
Whiskey breath and cigarettes
There's smell perfume and that's as good as it gets
She taught me how to dance in a Spanish town
She got a kick out of watching me spin round and round
Stars shawn bright and the moon hung low
Willie Digger singing on the radio
Well it's a sad song night
With a long ago girl running through my mind
It's a sad song night
Ain't nothing stops time like a sad song night
Sad song night
She came in the room, wild flowers in her hair
She lit the way with a hundred candles up the stairs
We made love in a Chinese lantern room
Ain't it a bitch it had to end so soon
Well it's a sad song night
With a long ago girl running through my mind
It's a sad song night
Ain't nothing stops time like a sad song
It's a sad song night
With a long ago girl running through my mind
Another sad song night
Ain't nothing stops time like a sad song night
Well I never went back to the Spanish town
Hung up my dancing shows
And the world kept on spinning round and round
I think of her when they play that song
Sometimes I even sing along...
Well it's a sad song night
With a long ago girl running through my mind
It's a sad song night
Ain't nothing stops time like a sad song
It's a sad song night
With a long ago girl running through my mind
Another sad song night
Ain't nothing stops time like a sad song
It's a sad song night
It's a sad song night
Sad song night
Sad song

Oh! You better watch out
You better not cry
You better not pout
I'm telling you why:
Santa Claus is coming to town!
He's making a list
Checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty or nice
Santa Claus is coming to town!
He sees you when you're sleeping
He knows when you're awake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake!
Oh! You better watch out
You better not cry

It's getting late have you seen my mates
Ma tell me when the boys get here
It's seven o'clock and I wanna rock
Wanna get a belly full of beer
My old man's drunker than a barrel full of monkeys
And the old lady she don't care
My sister looks cute in her braces and boots
A handful of grease in her hair
Don't give us none of your aggravation
We had it with your discipline
Saturday night's alright for fighting
Get a little action in
Get about as oiled as a diesel train
Gonna set this dance alight
'Cause Saturday night's the night I like
Saturday night's alright (alright, alright)
Well they're packed pretty tight in here tonight
I'm looking for a dolly who'll see me right
I may use a muscle to get what I need
I may sink a little drink and shout out "She's with me!"
A couple of the sound that I really like
Are the sounds of a switchblade and a motorbike
I'm a juvenile product of the working class
Whose best friend floats in the bottom of a glass
Don't give us none of your aggravation
We had it with your discipline
Saturday night's alright for fighting
Get a little action in
Get about as oiled as a diesel train
Gonna set this dance alight
Saturday night's the night I like
Saturday night's alright (alright, alright)
Saturday 9X night's alright
Saturday 9X night's alright
Bring it down
Saturday 9X night's alright
Saturday 9X night's alright
Saturday 9X night's alright

Dear Lord, Jesus, Buddah, Allah or can I just call you Joe
I've got a lot of things to tell you and some things I gotta know
I'm tired of hearing talk about this world's about to end
If we can die together then can't we all be friends
I gotta know
Hey, I gotta know
So Mister can you tell me, gotta know
Baby can you tell me, gotta know
Whoa oh oh I gotta know
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, I gotta know
Baby can you help me, gotta know
I gotta know
Did you ever feel like you were drowning,
did you ever feel betrayed by a kiss?
Did you ever feel like you needed somebody,
would you feel alone in a world like this?
Did you ever feel like you needed shelter,
did you ever laugh when you wanted to cry?
Did you ever dream about evolution,
don't you ever feel like your living a lie?
Oh, Whoa, too many children grow up blind to the truth.
I say, Oh Oh, Oh, Oh,
say a prayer for me,
I'll save a prayer for you.
Did you ever feel like you were helpless,
did you ever feel like an open wound?
Did you ever feel that there ain't no forgiveness,
did you ever feel that close to the.truth.
Oh Whoa, the world closed their eyes on the blinding truth.
I say, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh , say a prayer for me,
and I'll save a prayer for you
I'll save a prayer for you, I'll save a prayer for you,
I'll save a prayer.... for you, for you, for you.
I'll save a prayer.
Did you ever feel like you need shelter,
did you ever feel like you lived through the flood?
Did you ever feel a lust for survival, did you ever feel, feel, feel?
The world keeps turning.
Rooms still burning.
There's too many hearts that haven't found a home.
This train's on the tracks and the world's on my back,
save a prayer for me and I'll save one for you.
No one to blame , but it's hard to explain,
why too many soul's are feeling so alone.
You've got to hold on if it's all you can do.
Save a prayer for me, I'll save a prayer for you.
I'll save a prayer for you, I'll save a prayer for you,
I'll Save a prayer....
for you, for you, for you.

1, 2, 3, 4
You can dance
Every dance with the guy who gives you the eye let him hold you tight
And you can smile
Every smile for the man who holds your hand beneath the pale moonlight
But don't forget
Who's taking you home and in whose arms you're gonna be
Oh darling, save the last dance for me
You can dance
Go and carry on till the night is gone go and have your fun
Laugh and sing
But while we're apart don't give your heart to just anyone
So don't forget
Who's taking you home and in whose arms you're gonna be
So darling, save the last dance for me
Baby don't you know I love you so
Can't you feel it when we touch
I'll never going to let you go
'Cause I love you so much
And you can dance
Go and carry on till the night is gone go and have your fun
And if he asks
Are you all alone, can he walk you home you must tell him no
So don't forget
Who's taking you home and in whose arms you're gonna be
Oh darling, save the last dance for me
Darling save the last dance for me
Darling save the last dance for me

Riding high, then shot down
I load my guns to fire another round
I look deep into your eyes
And can't run there's nowhere left to hide.
Don't stop, no it's much too late
When the night comes I can't wait
Oh I live, love to loose control
It makes me crazy I want to let you know.
Oh, no, I don't want to fall
Oh, oh, can't you hear me calling
All night long in my secret dreams
You tell me I'm the one
When I'm next to you-next to you.
All I want in my secret dreams
Is you here with me.
I got to get to you, get to you, get to you.
There's a thrill, in the chase
We won't lose when we meet face to lace.
Love, games a means without and end.
I go down but I'll be back again
Thru' the night with no retreat
When your with me in my sleep.
Oh, no, I don't want to fall
Oh, oh, can't you hear me calling
All night long in my secret dreams
You tell me I'm the one
When I'm next to you-next to you.
All I want in my secret dreams
Is you here with me.
I got to get to you, get to you, get to you...
All night long in my secret dreams
You tell me I'm the one
When I'm next to you-next to you.
All I want in my secret dreams
Is you here with me.
I got to get to you, get to you, get to you.
I can see you
I feel you every night
I need you
But I'm only dreaming
All night long in my secret dreams
You tell me I'm the one
When I'm next to you-next to you.
All I want in my secret dreams
Is you here with me.

Si el camino surge de la nada,
será que mi canción ,
llego hasta el sol.
Si algo te sacude sin sentido
será que la canción ,
llego hasta el sol.
La tristeza se va como una luz,
todo es armonía a mi alrededor,
y esta bien.
Alguien va subiendo la colina,
será que la canción,
llego hasta el sol,
Y otro va muy loco,
hundido en su mente,
será que la canción,
llego hasta el sol.
Una brisa volara en el amanecer
y un extraño tiempo ,
nos envolverá por fin.
Esta noche se oirá
dentro de tu piel,
no hay ningún momento ,
que se pueda comparar al amor.
Si se escucha el eco,
si el viento dice adiós,
será que la canción,
llego hasta el sol.

Johnny was a school boy when he heard his first Beatles song
Love Me Do, I think it was and from there it didn't take him long
Got himself a guitar, used to play every night
Now he's in a rock & roll outfit, and everything's all right
Don't you know?
Johnny told his momma, he said momma I'm goin' away
I'm gonna hit the big time, gonna be a big star someday
Momma came to the door with a tear drop in her eye
Johnny said, don't cry momma, smile & say goodbye
Don't you know?
Don't you know that you are a shooting star?
Don't you know, oh yeah
Don't you know that you are a shooting star?
And all the world is gonna love you just as long
As long as you are
Johnny made a record, went straight up to number one
Suddenly everybody wanted to hear him sing the song
Watching the world go by, surprisin' it goes so fast
Johnny looked around him and said, I made the big time at last
Don't you know, oh yeah
Don't you know that you are a shooting star?
Don't you know?
Don't you know that you are a shooting star?
And all the world is gonna love you just as long
As long as you are, yeah, yeah
That's right, yeah
Johnny died one night, died in his bed
Bottle of whiskey, sleepin' tablets in his head
Johnny's life passed him by like a warm summer day (warm summer day)
When you listen to the wind, you can still hear him play
Don't you know, oh yeah
Don't you know that you are a shooting star?
Don't you know, don't you, don't you, don't you, don't you know?
Don't you know that you are a shooting star?

I don't wanna talk about it
Baby wanna talk all night
You're on your feet six days a week
We're working nights just trying to make ends meet
We break our backs on the killing floor
Another guy's what's we're doing it for
We got a lot, we don't more
Refrão:
We're rolling, baby
Tell me when you go
Rolling, ready
Tell me where to go
I don't wanna watch the TV
Wash the dishes now or pay the bills
Don't wanna eat, don't need to sleep
The only real meal that gives me a thrill
Don't need no candles, you're the spark
Don't need no matches, just a fire in the dark
We come together and that's a good start
Baby, we're crazy
And I know that you can't hide
'Cause the earth anywhere
There up on the other side
We break our backs on the killing floor
Another guy's what's we're doing it for
We got a lot, we don't more
Refrão
Baby, we're crazy

Like a fool I went and stayed too long
Now I'm wondering if your love's still strong
Oo, baby, here I am, signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours!
Then that time I went and said goodbye
Now I'm back and not ashamed to cry
Oo, baby, here I am, signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours!
Here I am baby
Signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours
Here I am baby
Signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours
I've done a lot of foolish things
That I really didn't mean
Seen a lot of things in this old world
When I touch them, they mean nothing, girl
Oo, baby, here I am, signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours!
Oowee baby, you set my soul on fire
That's how you know you're my heart's desire
Oo, baby, here I am, signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours!
Here I am baby
Signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours
Here I am baby
Signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours
I've done a lot of foolish things
That I really didn't mean, girl
Here I am baby
Signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours
Here I am baby
Signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours
Come on baby, one more time
Here I am baby
Signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours
Here I am baby
Signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours

Sittin' in the classroom thinkin' it's a drag
Listening to the teacher rap -- just ain't my bag
When two bells ring you know it's my cue
Gonna meet the boys on floor number 2
Smokin' in the boys room
Smokin' in the boys room
Teacher don't you fill me up with your rules
Everybody knows that smokin' ain't allowed in school
Checkin' out the halls makin' sure the coast is clear
Lookin' in the stalls -- nah, there ain't nobody here
My buddies Sixx, Mick & Tom
To get caught would surely be the death of us all
Smokin' in the boys room
Smokin' in the boys room
Teacher don't you fill me up with your rules
Everybody knows that smokin' ain't allowed in school
Put me to work in the school bookstore
Check-out counter, and I got bored
Teacher was lookin' for me all around
Two hours later you know where I was found
Smokin' in the boys room
Smokin' in the boys room
Teacher don't you fill me up with your rules
Everybody knows that smokin' ain't allowed in school
Smokin' in the boys room
Smokin' in the boys room
Smokin' in the boys room
Smokin' in the boys room
Teacher don't you fill me up with your rules
Everybody knows that smokin' ain't allowed in school
One more time
Smokin' in the boys room
Smokin' in the boys room
Teacher I ain't foolin' around with your rules
Everybody knows that smokin' ain't allowed in school

You can read it in the papers
In some places it comes in thirty-two flavors
But you wouldn't tell no one
Your favorite if you could
From the White House to the alleys
From the President down to Long Tall Sally
Can't live with it but you'll die without it
Yes you would
Senorita's in the kitchen
She's a fistful of dynamite
You call 911 but you can't stop the fun tonight, it's alright
You can't start a fire without a spark
But there's something that I guarantee
You can't hide when infection starts
Because love is a social disease
Where you look you can find it
Try to run but you're always behind it
So you play hide and seek like a blind kid
Till you're caught, yeah you're caught
So you'll say that you had some
But they took it and held it for ransom
Were they tall, dark, skinny or handsome
You won't talk
So you telephone your doctor
Just to see what pill to take
You know there's no prescription
Gonna wipe this one away
You can't start a fire without a spark
But there's something that I guarantee
You can't hide when infection starts
Because love is a social disease
So full of high grade octane
She could run the bullet train on 38 double d's
Now you know for sure, you know the cure
To make a blind man see

Marry me to the blue sky
Bury me in that long last drop of hard rain
Meet me where they stop time
That’s you to me on the shovel
That’s digging deep grave
Till I can waltz on the moonbeam
Till I can find a way to turn all tears into wine
I’ll hitch my ride to a daydream
We can’t unkiss the lips that love is leaving behind
I ain’t living with the ghost
No future living in the past
I’ve seen what hate has done to hope
Tomorrow wasn’t built to last
I ain’t living with the ghost
How can I scream I’m scared to breathe?
I wrote each word you gave the toast
But we were fire and gasoline
I ain’t living with the ghost
I set my sails over wheat fields
Rode waves of amber let a new sunshine on my face
I dropped the sword, put down my shield
I left your scars for the stars that are guiding my way
I traded hurting for healing, I must admit that I was reeling
Now I’m feeling just fine
Traded nightmares for dreaming
Go tell your shadows that I got out alive!
I ain’t living with the ghost
No future living in the past
I’ve seen what hurt has done to hope
I found the tree, I cut the rope
Tomorrow wasn’t built to last
I ain’t living with the ghost
How can I scream I’m scared to breathe?
I wrote each word you gave the toast
But we were fire and gasoline
I ain’t living with the ghost
Last night I had this dream
I saw a man wash his feet in the church holy water
Then he worked up to his knees
From his arms to his neck
Said I’m in over my head
He was crying, trying to get some relief
Lord, I’m just trying to get some relief
I had this dream
That man was me
I ain’t living with the ghost
No future living in the past
I’ve seen what hurt has done to hope
I found the tree, I cut the rope
Tomorrow wasn’t built to last
I ain’t living with the ghost
How can I scream I’m scared to breathe?
I wrote each word you gave the toast
But we were fire and gasoline
I ain’t living with the ghost
This isn’t how the story ends
My friends it’s just a fork along the road
Don’t say your prayers, save your amens
You’ve come this far, but you’re still far from home
Don’t say goodbye, just say farewell
Write every line you’ll live to tell
Hold your head high, like harry
Give ‘em hell
As the night ignites the day
Make some memories along the way, ay
Write your song
Sing along
Love your life
Learn to laugh
Dare to dance
Touch the sky
Take pictures each step of the way
Make this the best of you the rest of your days
Start your revolution
And I’ll see you at the reunion
Some friends will go and some will stay
Ok, some last a chapter, some a page
For some, love some disguised as lust
But you’ll find love when you find trust one day
Do better than our parent did
Imperfect husband, wife and kids
Go chart your course, then turn it upside down
Go live your life eyes open wide
Who’s to say what’s wrong or right? Right?
Write your song
Sing along
Love your life
Learn to laugh
Dare to dance
Touch the sky
Take pictures each step of the way
Make this the best of you the rest of your days
Start your revolution
And I’ll see you at the reunion
As the night ignites the day
Make some memories along the way!
Write your song
Sing along
Love your life
Learn to laugh
Dare to dance
Touch the sky
Take pictures each step of the way
Make this the best of you the rest of your days
Start your revolution
And I’ll see you at the reunion
I say go start your own revolution

Kids are rockin' to the radio, you got your friends in the car rarin' to go
The DJ tells you it's almost time for the show
Where's Roxy in the mirror fixin' her hair, looking at the stockings that she wants to wear
Front row tickets everybody's gonna be there
And they're singing oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh
The night it comes to set the scene
And the band arrives in a limousine
Flash your cameras, still seems like a dream
Everybody's walking forward in the hall
Walkin' the seats at the Rock 'n Roll ball
Lipstick ladies driving you crazy
You know you can't sit down because you got to stand up, stand up
That's all you got to do, stand up, stand up the music'll pull you through
Stand up, stand up, all ya gotta do is
Stand up, stand up, the time is here and tonight we're here for you
All right, yeah, it's getting late so you can't go far
The roadie tunes that last guitar
The band can't wait to hit the stage, anticipation would turn the page
Roxie's old manager, she had to ask
Whatcha gotta do for a backstage pass
Get you down to the dressing room
Honey, all you got to do is oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh
All you got to do is stand up, stand up
That's all you got to do, just stand up, stand up
Let the music pull you through, you gotta stand up, stand up
That's all you gotta do, you gotta stand up, stand up
Cause the time is here baby, now we're here for you

BOUNCE B-side
What ya gonna to say about me
I ain't already thought?
What ya gonna try and sell me

You wrap yourself in my colors

You reel me in and run me over

I'm stubborn and proud
I'm raising these hands
Gonna shout it out loud
Standing, I'm still standing

You know me, my hands are dirty
Gonna pound my chest
Just as soon kill as kiss me
Do your worst, bring out my best
Don't play for no one
Don't give an inch
Push when the wind is blowing
Hey, hey, hey, hey
I'm a son of a bitch I don't take no shit
I won't back down
Standing, I'm still standing
I've got my feet on the ground
Standing, I'm still standing
Now I ain't giving in so figure it out
I'm wild and I'm free
I'm stubborn and proud
I'm raising these hands
Gonna shout it out loud

I been waiting, standing in the dark for hours
Tryin' a find the faith and the power to get back home to you
It's been a long time, long time since I've seen your face
But on and on I could not replace
The fire that burns for you, yeah
So here's to the good times, here to the bad
Here's to the memories that we all had
Here's to tomorrow, let yesterday pass us by
Tonight, we'll be starting all over again
And it feels like the first time I.....
No I'll never feel this way again
Starting all over again
Do you remember, remember the odds we were given
We had nothing and we thought that was living
Lord and it's been such a long, long road
Long, long road
Here's to our old friends who helped us get by
Here's to the dreamers, may their dreams never die
If we believe we can keep all the good times alive
Tonight, we'll be starting all over again
And it feels like the first time I.....
No I'll never feel this way again
Whoa oh, tonight, we'll be starting all over again
And it feels like the first time I.....
Know whenever we're together my friends it's like starting all over again
Tonight, we'll be starting all over again
And it feels like the first time I.....
No I'll never feel this way again
Whoa oh, tonight, we'll be starting all over again
And it feel like the first time I....
Know whenever we're together my friends it's like starting all over again

He says he's your friend, but you don't see hin
He says that he's so damn busy, but he don't know
nothing at all
You get hin on the phone, he was just gonna call you
Says he's been thinking about old times
And Looking at you picture on the wall
Chorus:
He's stringin' ou the same old lines
That he puts everyone through
They're only lies, intentions just won't do
At times it fees all wrong
Till he finds out we've caught on
He's stringin' a line, he's stringin' a line
So you try to forget, but that ain't so easy
Cause if you've got one small doubt
There was never anything there
You dangle on line, a captive fool
Well you know he'll try again
And it will just be the same as last time
Chorus (2x)...
I Lost you Chasing those Hollywood Dreams
You Smiled for the camera, is all they ever say
Transmitting my emotions, a thousand miles away
They chased me through the streets, callin' out my name
I'm coming home to you this, life is driving me insane
Climbing up the stairs, knocking on the door
She don't recognize me, don't want me anymore
Chorus (3x)

About a-workin' all summer just a-trying to earn a dollar
Every time I call my baby, try to get a date
The boss says: "No dice son you gotta work a-late"
Some times I wonder what I'm a gonna do
But there ain't no cure for the summertime blues
Well my mom and pappa told me
"Son you gotta earn some money if you wanna
Use the car to go a riding next sunday"
Well I didn't got to work told the boss I was sick
"Now you can't use the car cause you didn't work a lick"
Sometimes I wonder what I'm a gonna do
But there ain't no cure for the summertime blues
It's gonna take two weeks for have my vacation,
I'm gonna take my problem to the united nations
Well I told my congress man and he said, quote:
"I'd like to help you son but you're too young to vote"
Sometimes I wonder what I'm a gonna do,
But there ain't no cure for the summertime blues

These seven days and nights
Are always blending
This so called tragic life
So where's that happy ending
Stuck at the traffic light
It's just the same old song
I'm humming all the words
But I won't sing along
Listen
I need something different
I'm tired of giving in
Time to start living
We're going to take back the night
Surrender to me and save my life
Let's start a fire, let's start a fight
We're going to take back the night
Do you want to be
Another casualty
The one who stands his ground
When everybody leaves
It's time for taking sides
It's time to face the truth
Too late for turning back
So whatcha going to do
Listen
I need something different
There's no time for reason
I'm tired of bleeding
We're going to take back the night
Surrender to me and save my life
Let's start a fire, let's start a fight
We're going to take back the night
Listen
I need something different
I'm tired of dreaming
This time I'm screaming
We're going to take back the night
Surrender to me and save my life
Let's start a fire, let's start a fight
We're going to take back the night
Take back the night
We're going to take back the night

Hey operator can you try long distance one more time
You must know that number now to get my baby on the line
Hey operator, I've been away so long now
Can't you see you're my last chance
I've got to get to her somehow
Kisses on your photograph, they tear at my heart
Music is playing and people are waiting
Take me home to rest this heart
Take me home to rest this heart
Yeah operator, I only want to hear her voice
I only want to say that I never meant to make her cry
Hey operator, I need you to understand
I don't mean to waste your time
But love makes you a desperate man
Kisses on your photograph, they tear at my heart
The music is playing and the people are waiting
Take me home to rest this heart
Take me home to rest this heart
Take me home to rest this heart
Take me home to see my baby once again

Another lonely night, on the telephone we talk
When will the lightening strike, the thundering roar
Pretending that you miss the touch of my caress
But our lips never met, cause one kiss could never last
Locked up inside your room
You play your lover's tunes
You dance all night, but you run out of moves
You're so close but out of reach
Your voice is haunting me
You've been talking in your sleep again
You talk in your sleep baby
You're talking in your sleep again
You talk in your sleep
You play so hard to get
I know you'll never change your ways
You make the minutes seem like hours
The hours seem like days
You know I'll come when you whisper
I'll run when you call
And when I'm calling out to you
Oh baby, I got no replies at all
This hide and seek were playing
Is such a vicious game
But it dont matter what you say
I love you anyway
Cause you've been talking in your sleep again
You talk in your sleep baby
You're talking in your sleep again
You talk in your sleep
You've been talking in your sleep again
You talk in your sleep
You've been talking in your sleep again
Talking in your sleep
You've been talking in your sleep again
You talk in your sleep baby
Talking in your sleep again
You talk in your sleep
You've been talking in your sleep again
You talk in your sleep baby
Talking in your sleep again

How i wish i could surrender my soul
Shed the clothes that become my skin
See the liar that burns within my needing
How i wish i had chosen darkness from cold
How i wish i could scream out load
Instead ive found no meaning
I guess its time i run far, far away. find comfort in pain
All pleasures the same it just keeps me from trouble
Hides my true shape, like dorian gray
I heard what they say, but im not here for trouble
Its more than just words, its just tears and rain
How i wish i could walk through the doors of my mind
Hold memory close at hand, help me understand the years
How i wish i could choose between heaven and hell
How i wish i could save my sole, im so cold from fear
I guess its time i run far, far away. find comfort in pain
All pleasures the same it just keeps me from trouble
Hides my true shape, like dorian gray
I heard what they say, but im not here for trouble
Far far away, find comfort in pain
All pleasures the same it just keeps me from trouble
Its more than just words, its just tears and rain
Far far away, find comfort in pain

You're my missing picture on my mirror
I'm running away from home
Sam I'm just a man a rusty bucket of flesh and bones
Someday I'll seek forgiveness for the sweet smell of her breath
She touched my hand and asked for a check I put out my cigarette
Temptation
Temptation, go home Lord
I'm walking straight into the ocean
Tell the tide I'm on my way
Gonna hang my head down tonight on Damocles sword
When the angels hung out in Eden
They caught Adam chasing Eve
They said grab your boots, your coat, your hat, my boy, it's time that you leave
She asked me if I liked to play 'cause she knew that I was broke
I cashed my chips out months ago
This smile is just mirrors and smoke
Temptation
Temptation, go home Lord
I'm walking straight into the ocean
Tell the tide I'm on my way
Gonna hang my head down tonight on Damocles sword
Twist my wrist
Tell me I should resist
But the flesh is weak
Here comes the kiss
Come on, twist my wrist
Can't go on like this
Ah the flesh, it's weak
Here is comes, here it comes
Temptation
Temptation, go home Lord
I'm walking straight into the ocean
Tell the tide I'm on my way
Gonna lay my head down tonight on Damocles sword
Temptation
Temptation, go home Lord
I'm walking straight into the ocean
Tell the tide I'm on my way
Gonna lay my head down tonight on Damocles sword
I'm gonna lay my head down tonight on Damocles sword
And hang my head down tonight on Damocles sword

(Composta para o Alice Cooper que nunca gravou a música)
Used to be a billion dollar baby
I used to be the eyes that made you scream
Used to be the one that I could talk to
But now there's something else [Alice?], there's you
and me
I used to think I really didn't need you
But I used to think that only women bleed
And I ain't gonna cry no more
I've been to hell and back before
Watch me as I walk out the door
Because Alice doesn't live here anymore

Guess who just got back today,
Them wild-eyed boys that'd been away,
Haven't changed, had much to say,
But man, I still think them cats are crazy
They were askin' if you were around,
How you was, where you could be found
Told them you were livin' downtown,
Drivin' all the old men crazy
*
The boys are back in town, the boys are back in town
The boys are back in town, the boys are back in town
You know that chick that used to dance a lot,
Every night, she'd be on the floor, shakin' what she's got
Man, when I tell ya she was cool, she was red hot
And that time over at Johnny's place,
Well, this chick, she got up and slapped Johnny's face,
Man, we just fell about the place,
If that chick don't wanna know, forget her
* Repeat
Friday night they'll be dressed to kill,
Down at Deano's bar and grill
The drink will flow, and blood will spill,
And if the boys wanna fight you better let 'em
That jukebox in the corner blasting out my favorite song,
The nights are gettin' warmer, it won't be long,
Won't be long 'til summer comes,
Now that the boys are here again
* Repeat

Put on your yarmulke
Here comes Chanukah
So much funukah
To celebrate Chanukah
Chanukah is the festival of lights
Instead of one day of presents, we have eight crazy nights
When you feel like the only kid in town without a christmas tree
Here's a list of people who are Jewish just like you and me
David Lee Roth lights the menorah
So do Kirk Douglas, James Caan and the late Dinah Shore-ah
Guess who eats together at the Carnegie Deli
Bowser from Sha Na Na and Arthur Fonzerelli
Paul Newman's half Jewish, Goldie Hawn's half too
Put them together, what a fine lookin' Jew
You don't need to "Deck the Halls" or "Jingle Bell Rock"
'Cause you can spin the dreidel with Captain Kirk and Mr. Spock - both Jewish
Put on your yarmulke
It's time for Chanukah
The owner of the Seattle Supersonicahs
Celebrates Chanukah
O.J. Simpson, not a Jew
But guess who is? Hall of famer Rod Carew - he converted
We got Ann Landers and her sister Dear Abby
Harrison Ford's a quarter Jewish - not too shabby
Some people think that Ebenezer Scrooge is
Well he's not, but guess who is
All Three Stooges
So many Jews are in showbiz
Tom Cruise isn't, but I heard his agent is
Tell your friend Veronica
It's time to celebrate Chanukah
I hope I get a harmonica
On this lovely, lovely Chanukah
So drink your gin and tonicah
And smoke your marijuanikah
If you really, really wannakah
Have a happy, happy, happy, happy Chanukah
Happy Chanukah

So now it's over let the spot light fade
I hear the music slowly fade away
And now i find it hard to say good bye
So I'll just say good night my friends
The end (we'll be together)
The end (we'll live forever)
We'll all be together in the end
The end (although it's over)
The end (It's never over)
We'll all be together in the end
If every moment is a memory
A faded photograph of days gone by
Can I take a little piece of you with me
For when I leave this all behind
The end (we'll be together)
The end (we'll live forever)
We'll all be together in the end
The end (although it's over)
The end (It's never over)
We'll all be together in the end
Come on, come on, come on, Darling... lay your head down amoment
Come on, come on, come on, little Darling, help me baby,
'Cause I ain't see the lights.....
I'm getting tired so I close my eyes
I need to look at you juste one more time
And though it's over, it's never over
Until I see you again
The end (we'll be together)
The end (we'll live forever)
We'll all be together in the end
The end (although it's over)
The end (It's never over)
We'll all be together in the end
The end (we'll be together)
The end (we'll live forever)
We'll all be together in the end
The end (although it's over)

We'll all be together in the end

I can see the sun goin' down
I still see the cars roll by
I can see that seaside pool
Where we spent those summer nights
And I can hear the moonlit ocean
And I can feel your hand in mine
I can taste the warm free ocean
What a vision in my mind
And I, I lie in waiting
And I'm anticipating the promise, the promise
I remember what you told me
We both sounded so sincere
You said you'd always be my baby
And I said baby I'll always be there
Well I remember our first time girl
I still see the beach that night
I remember we were scared girl
But we both know that it felt so right
Time can never change it
And I'll never break it
The promise, the promise
Was made for nights like this
Seal it with your kiss
The promise, with the promise
Now the summer sun is gone
For the young ones who are left to carry on
The promise, the promise

You know I need you baby
Yeah, you know I do
Feel like you've been left alone
And there's nothing here for you
I know how long you've been waiting
It's closing time once again
If he don't even come around to rescue you, what then?
But who am I to talk?
Cause my guitar's my only friend
And if you'd like I'll drive you home
Pour you a drink and we'll pretend
But you and I are both married
Bought that big house and car
Remember living on easy street
Instead of being where we are
And trying to face the sole truth
You can't escape the sole truth
And if you just believe me, that's all that's left to do
There's nothing more that I can do
Than face the sole truth
Say this guy is lying every time it rains
Every drop of rain that falls, you just feel your pain
It's time you stopped all the crying
It's time we bury the past
I know that you can do better than me
And maybe that's why I hurt
Well lately I've been thinking
Maybe I'm too young
Remember keep on going baby
There's just one thing I can't run from
You're still bringing me here, baby
To this place we call home
To face our failures all by myself
At least we won't be alone
There's the sole truth
Can't erase the sole truth
If you just believe me, that's all that's left to do
Nothing more that I can do
Face the sole truth
I don't want to fall in love again
If you got to know the truth
Then I don't want to fall in love tonight
Cause I couldn't bear to lose
Now the sun is coming up
Why don't we shut this damn place down
Tomorrow we can laugh this off
I've had my share of whiskey here to drown
As you walk to your car there's nothing more I can do
Face to face with the sole truth
Can't escape the sole truth
You can't erase the sole truth
Can't escape the sole truth

To me it's all too late
Inside my aching head
Pictures of you on my wall
See em time and time again
Wonder where you are tonight
Wonder who you're with
Remember I swore love that night
You sealed it with your kiss
My heart it beats but I'm not alive
Took a part of me when you said goodbye
I'll take the right side
Love on the wrong side
There ain't no right side
Love on the wrong side
Daddy says were from different worlds
Boys like me don't date daddy's girl
If you build you a wall it can lock you in
You say that I lose, hope that I win
I'll have my chance
My heart it beats but I'm not alive
Took a part of me when you said goodbye
Tell me who says its a crime
There ain't no right side
Love on the wrong side
There ain't no right side
Love on the wrong side

These days what's left to me ain't no Prince Charming
And my Cinderella feels like she stayed at the dance too long
We ain't got much but what we got is all that matters
We're pickin' up the pieces, tryin' to put 'em back where they belong
Ohh, it's gonna be alright
This is love, this is life
When times get tough we're still worth the fight
This is love, this is life
The road here's paved with the brokenhearted
We gotta finish what we started
Ohhh, better hold on tight
This is love, this is life
These days it seems like there's three sides to every story
There's yours, mine, lately there's the cold hard truth
Who cares who's wrong or right when we turn out the lights?
We'll find forgiveness when we're in each other's arms tonight
It ain't pretty but somehow we always make it through
Ohh, it's gonna be alright
This is love, this is life
When times get tough we're still worth the fight
This is love, this is life
The road here's paved with the brokenhearted
We gotta finish what we started
Ohhh, better hold on tight
This is love, this is life
Ohh, it's gonna be alright
This is love, this is life
When times get tough we're still worth the fight
This is love, this is life
The road here's paved with the brokenhearted
We gotta finish what we started
Ohhh, better hold on tight
This is love, this is life
Ohh, ohh, ohh

Love makes us laugh, love makes us cry
We're up and we're down, we don't understand why
But we take it, we're just trying to make it
Sometimes we lose touch with our feelings inside
Put up our walls when we injure our pride
And we break up, only to make up
Easy, love has never been easy
And I've been searching, trying every door
Until I finally found what I was looking for
And it takes what it takes, we all make mistakes
There are so many mountains to climb
But I know that our love will survive
Baby this time
Well we heal from the pain and we learn from the past
The future is ours and now we found it at last
We both know it, can't help but show it
Easy, love has never been easy
And I've been searching, trying every door
Until I finally found what I was looking for
And it takes what it takes, we all make mistakes
There are so many mountains to climb
But I know that our love will survive
Baby this time
There were so many times when the road got rough
Thought that we'd both had enough
But we kept it alive, somehow the love wouldn't die
And it takes what it takes, we all make mistakes
There are so many mountains to climb
But I know that our love will survive
And it takes what it takes, we all make mistakes
There are so many mountains to climb
But I know that our love will survive
Baby this time

She can steal the stars and the moon
She can kill you with a wink of an eye
She's not like those other girls who fall in love the very first time
She's so young, she's old enough for me
And she's so shy, it's a love that I'm gonna see
This woman is dangerous
She'll break your heart and keep you runnin' back for more
This woman is dangerous
But I'm gonna love her like she's never been in love before
This woman is dangerous
I'm just another fool waitin' outside her door
She knew who were the men and who were the boys
She could tell you what they want by the price of their toys
She'd play those game of love, she made a little bit a lot of fun
She started messin' your head up, you're playin' with a loaded gun
This woman is dangerous
She'll break your heart and keep you runnin' back for more
This woman is dangerous
And I'm gonna love her like she's never been in love before
This woman is dangerous
I'm just another fool waitin' outside her door
She'll take you, break you, there's magic in her kiss
I don't know how many nights I'll go on like this
Her touch is warm, her heart is cold, she'll cut you like a knife
But it don't matter what she is, cause I want her in my life
This woman is dangerous
She'll break your heart and keep you runnin' back for more
This woman is dangerous
And I'm gonna love her like she's never been in love before

In a time, in a place
In a world, they forgot
Lives the heart of me
A part that just won't die
Just a boy, not a man
Sent to war, in a land
They said we'd fight for their freedom
But I felt like a hired hand
Sometimes I have to find my way
Sometimes I have to get away
Take me back to Tokyo Road
Take me back to Tokyo Road
Working hard, for a pass
Got the night, make it last
It was a time to remember
All my life I would never forget
In a bar, breathing smoke
Snorting whiskey, drinking coke
It was a time when no one would die
And there wasn't a care
Sometimes I wish it was that way
Cause sometimes I have to get away
Take me back to Tokyo Road
Take me back to Tokyo Road
Take me back to Tokyo Road
Take me back to Tokyo Road
This guy turns me around and he's pointing up the stairs
I found myself in her doorway but there wasn't anybody there
She walked in the room with nothing on but a red light
And with a smile she got so close to me.
She whispered something 'bout midnight
You know I didn't understand a word she said
But it felt so good
She knew that I didn't have any money
But baby I knew she would...
Take me back to Tokyo Road
Take me back to Tokyo Road

Love is like quicksand
It's always bringing me down
But I still keep coming back for more
And like an addiction
One is never enough
I'm like a junkie at your door
Too much of a good thing
Is like getting high and coming down
Refrão:
My heart's on a string
I've been blind to the sting
Getting much too much of a good thing
I came to your party
And stayed a little too late
You woke up naked on the floor
You are my strongest weakness
And I don't want nothing else
You got the fix I'm looking for
Too much of a good thing
Will turn your whole world upside down
Refrão
She's my favorite disease
Makes me crawl on my knees
Getting much too much of a good thing
Like you partied all night
And you're too trashed from drinking
The only way out is another shot glass to sink in
Tell me, baby, what'll it take
I keep making the same mistakes
Refrão
And I know it's no good
Yeah, I'd quit if I could
Getting much too much
Getting much too much
Oh, it's just too much of a good thing

People people everywhere
There's revolution in the air
Protest signs and people walking
Talking heads on TV talking
Pick a team, choose your side
Ain't no room for compromise
We're running out of better days
Brother all I'm trying to say
You see black and I see white
No two hearts can beat the same
In a world of many colors
There's a little touch of grey
I say wrong when you say right
Different faces different names
Brother brother brother
It's ok to say: Hey, hey, hey
I see things with a little touch of grey
If I whisper will you listen
Will I answer if you scream
Politics and bad religion
Took a hammer to the dream
Everybody loves their children
Forgiveness and a second chance
One more thing we got in common
Ain't love why we do this dance
Ain't love why we do this dance
You see black and I see white
No two hearts can beat the same
In a world of many colors
There's a little touch of grey
I say wrong when you say right
Different faces different names
Brother brother brother
It's ok to say: Hey, hey, hey
I see things with a little touch of grey
I believe there's train still coming
I believe there's room on board
Break the chains and raise your hands up
Be the change we're looking for

Women think I'm tasty, but they're always tryin' to waste me
And make me burn the candle right down,
But baby, baby, I don't need no jewels in my crown.
'Cause all you women is low down gamblers,
Cheatin' like I don't know how,
But baby, baby, there's fever in the funk house now.
This low down bitchin' got my poor feet a itchin',
You know you know the duece is still wild.
Baby, I can't stay, you got to roll me
And call me the tumblin' dice.
Always in a hurry, I never stop to worry,
Don't you see the time flashin' by.
Honey, got no money,
I'm all sixes and sevens and nines.
Say now, baby, I'm the rank outsider,
You can be my partner in crime.
But baby, I can't stay,v You got to roll me and call me the tumblin',
Roll me and call me the tumblin' dice.
Oh, my, my, my, I'm the lone crap shooter,
playin' the field ev'ry night.
Baby, can't stay,
You got to roll me and call me the tumblin' (dice),
Roll me and call me the tumblin' (Got to roll me.) dice.
Got to roll me. Got to roll me

Another night in this old town
Sometimes growin' up can only bring you down
Sometimes I sit, I wonder
Sometimes I scream as loud as thunder
Little brother don't you know I'm a man
They might think I'm just a boy
But they don't understand
These city streets, they tell me stories about busted dreams and faded glory
No one seems to understand
They tell me walk, don't run, the time will find you
Walk, don't run and your heart will guide you to
Walk, don't run, they say growing up it just ain't so much fun
I feel like a loaded gun
They say don't run
My mom and dad work every day
Just to keep shoes on our feet they slaved their lives away
Grandpa had to do the same, it took him to an early grave
Call me a rebel, say the boy don't think
I'm old enough to fight for my country
I ain't old enough for a drink
And I'm not a pawn, I can't play their game
But Poppa I'm proud just to wear your name
Then he held out his hand, he said I understand
But remember walk, don't run, the time will find you
Walk, don't run and your heart will guide you to
Walk, don't run, just walk, don't run

Burn these fields, pave them black
Leave this place and I'll never look back
Fill my mind with your silent streets
A sea of waving heat
Could be a lover
Like in your wildest dreams
I run for cover
Come apart at the seams
Just like a mother
Who's wasted and scared
Bury me in the rain
Oh warchild, my mama says
Bury me in an unmarked grave
And wash my ashes again and again
I was born to trouble
I was born to pain
Bury me in the rain
Oh warchild, my mama says
Now they're screaming
Running wild, child
What's wrong now? wharchild
I will kill all of the lies you tell
It's your hell, warchild
Oh mercy mercy me
I can't find no light to see
And the streets, they get so cold
And the nights will make you old
Is there nothing I can do
Before it tears me in two
Oh mercy mercy me, child
Why can't they let me be?
Is it something that I've done
Keeps me always on the run?
Is there something I can say
Is there nothing I can do
Before it tears me in two
Child, get out
Can't you tell me
Can't you tell me, child?
Could be a lover
Like in your wildest dreams
I run for cover
Come apart at the seams
Just like a mother
Who's wasted and scared
Bury me in the rain
Now I'm a liar, I am greed
I light a fire and burn to be freed
But still this memory
Hangs round my head
Everything you said
Bury me in the rain
Bury me in the rain, oh in the rain

In this dirty old part of the city
Where the sun refuse to shine
People tell me there ain't no use in trying
Now, my girl, you're so young and pretty
And one thing I know is true
You'll be dead before your time is due
I know
Watch my daddy in bed and tired
Watch his hair been turning gray
He's been working and slaving his life away
Oh yes, I know it
He's been working so hard
I've been working too, babe
Every night and day
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
We gotta get out of this place
If its the last thing we ever do
We gotta get out of this place
'Cause, girl, there's a better life
For me and you

For me and you
Somewhere, baby
Somehow I know it, baby

Today you'll pick up all the pieces
And get on with your life
All I can hope is that you're happy
'Cause today you're someone elses wife
Right now I wish that I could turn back
And beg the hands of time
For the days that I remember (oh baby)
The days when you were mine
And if I never said I love you
It's cause the words got in the way
Now all I do is say I'm sorry
Sorry I missed your wedding day
I'll bet you looked good at the altar
I'll bet he knew the words to say
And the angels smiled when you walked down the aisle
You both knelt down to pray
As he put his ring on your finger
I know there's just one thing left to say
All I can do is say I'm sorry
Sorry I missed your wedding day
So Sorry
(solo)
You won't be walking through the door anymore
You won't be sleeping in this bed anymore
Tho' I swear I see your shadow waltz accross my floor
And I don't know if I can take it
Should we ever meet again
Cause I know that we'll be strangers
When he introduces friends
I tried to make it to the church now baby
A broken heart got in the way
All I can do is tell you I'm sorry
Sorry I missed your wedding day
I really hope you're happy baby
Tho' it's killing me to say
All I can do is say I'm sorry
Sorry I missed you're wedding day
Sorry I missed you're wedding
I'm sorry I missed you're wedding day
I'm sorry I missed you're wedding day
I'm sorry I missed you're wedding day

I had enough of staring down at my shoes
Filling my cup with television's bad news
All of it's worthless, nothing to hold on to
Kicked out because there's nothing left but me and you
A little beat up but what you get's what you see
A bit of a rebel, a little bit of refugee
Waited my whole life away
Been waiting for someone like you to say
Welcome, welcome to the good times
Take it in like fine wine, until you feel alright
Welcome to the good times, yeah
I'm always the one on the outside looking inside
Always the bridesmaid, never been the new bride
Sometimes I feel like a canary in a coal mine
It's hard to breathe but somehow it's got to stay in flight
Waiting for the dice to roll our way
We've been waiting for someone somewhere to say
Welcome, welcome to the good times
Take it in like fine line, until you feel alright
Welcome, forget about the hard times
Gonna make the sun shine if it takes all night
Say welcome to the good times
Welcome, welcome to the good times
Take it in like fine wine until you feel alright
Welcome, forget about the hard times
Gonna make the sun shine if it takes us all night
We'll say welcome, welcome to the good times
Take it in like fine wine until you feel alright, alright
Welcome, welcome to the good times
Take it in like fine wine, until you feel alright
Welcome, welcome to the good times

I don't care about where you've been
I don't care about anything but today
And baby you and me
When you walked in my life
I thought this is the one that's true
There's the girl that's going to be my wife
I'll give you all the love you can handle
What you got is what you see
She swore to see a better man inside of me
What you want
Well, you can get it from me
What you need
I'll be giving for free
But I'm leaving in the morning and I'll be gone
I took her home through a parking lot
Up to that old forgotten spot
Where all the tough guys used to go
They were all so close to me
I swore I'd make her my one and only
Then I felt her pull away from me
And she said "Don't make promises you know you won't keep"
"Don't say you love me just do it"
Come on baby make it over the seats then get down to it
What you want
Well, you can get it from me
What you need
I'll be giving for free
But I'm leaving in the morning and I'll be gone
What you want
Well, you can get it from me
What you need
I'll be giving for free
I'm leaving in the morning and I'll, oh baby I'll be gone
What you want
Well, you can get it from me
What you need
I'll give it for free
I'm leaving in the morning, take tonight, let's go
What you want
Well, you can get it from me

When the sun comes up I'm gone

You're all I've ever wanted, I always want you to be mine
Let's make a promise till the end of time
We'll always be together and our love will never die

Outside this world keeps turnin' 'round
London Bridge keeps burnin' down
But it'll be all right, oooh
No one hears our silent screams
In this land of broken dreams
But it'll be all right, when she comes
It'll be all right, when she comes
It'll be all right, when she comes
And when I lie she still believes
She don't ask why, she's there for me
When it gets hard, she's all I need to get by
I hear her voice in a thousand places
I try so hard, still I can't escape it
She's the one, when she comes, yeah
And if the sky come falling down,
I never ever even hear a sound
It's true, she's as great a red
As blue as skies are blue
Everything's all right, when she comes
Everything's all tight, when she comes
And when I lie, she still believes
She don't ask why, she's there for me
When it gets hard, she's all I really need

We were young, unafraid
We were finding our own way
There is no wind, there is no rain
In the eye of the hurricane
Every time you climb that mountain
There’s another one left to climb
Don’t go looking for tomorrow
Leaving yesterday behind
Writing every page together
Those days were not to last forever
Diamonds in the rough
When we were us
Burn the house and torch the skyline
There was more than fire in my eyes
Love meant more than lust
When we were us
We were one, born and raised
More than blood runs through these veins
Cuts can heal, scars will fade
What we had will never change
Seasons pass and time will move on
You don’t ever have to let it go
You can go only so far now
Till your on your way back home
Writing every page together
Those days were not to last forever
Diamonds in the rough
When we were us
Burn the house and torch the skyline
There was more than fire in our eyes
Love meant more than lust
When we were us
Memories are nothing more than ghost that we let in
Don’t be afraid of them, do you remember when
Writing every page together
Those days were not to last forever
Diamonds in the rough
When we were us
Burn the house and torch the skyline
There was more than fire in our eyes
Love meant more than lust
When we were us
When we were us

You say you've seen it before
it's time you realize
The promisse they never meant to keep
They're nothing more than lies
You can come to me with your problems
How he turned you on with his lines
There ain't no use in pretending
Cause you know love is blind
Who hurt you this time
Layin' you heard on the live
Chorus:
Who said it would last forever
And he's never break your heart
You should have known better
That lovers sometimes part
So baby stop crying
And wipe those tears out from you eyes
It's time to get back on you feet again
Life's full of alibis
If I've told you once (once)
I've told you twice (twice)
Said it a thousand times before
You're so young and too innocent
You keep on comin' back for more
Who hurt you this time
When you lay your heart on the live
Chorus
So old you head up high
It's lonely in the dark
Let someone else try to mend your broken heart
To make a brand new start of things and I
Give you everything that you want this time
Chorus 2x
Who said it would last forever (3X)

When you walked into the party
The guests all disappeared
You dropped in with a group of friends
I didn't notice they were there
Was it the way your fingers held that glass?
The way your lips broke when you left?
I don't care if the devil is keeping score
For just one look I'd crawl across the floor
Who would you die for?
Who would you die for?
Leave brand me lipstick glitters
You miss me when I am gone
Wake up tangled in the sheets
Too aching for my arms
The way you move it's almost holy
Hop and you don't know your only
All I want is all of you and more
The big bad wolf is knocking at your door
Who would you die for? Who would you die for?
I wanna know (who would you die for?)
Your secret and your saints, I wanna feel your breathe out and in
I wanna know, I wanna know
Who would you die for? Who would you die for?
I wanna know what makes you feel, I wanna know love truly is
I wanna know what makes you feel, I wanna know love truly is
I wanna know what makes you feel, I wanna know love truly is
I wanna know what makes you feel, I wanna know love truly is
When you walked into the party
It was like the guests all disappeared
You dropped in with a group of friends
I didn't notice they were there
Was it the way your fingers held that glass?
The way your lips broke when you left?
I don't care if the devil is keeping score
For just one kiss I'd crawl across the floor
Who would you die for? Who would you die for?
I wanna know, your secret and your saints, I wanna feel you breathe out and in
I wanna know, I wanna know
Who would you die for? Who would you die for?
I wanna know
Who would you die for?
I wanna know
Who would you die for?
I wanna know
Who would you die for?
I wanna know

I could roll the dice
And give you ten good reasons
I could break the ice
And pick up the broken pieces
I could wave hello
I could raise a glass
I could blow a kiss
I could kick your ass
We could take it all apart
Or hold it all together
With these two hands
I can tear down walls
I can build a bridge
I can break my fall
With these two hands
I can pray or fight
I can hold the torch
I can shine a light
With these two hands
I could strike a match
That sets the world on fire
Hold a grain of sand
Till it turns into a diamond
I could plant the seed
I could flip that switch
Make the sign of peace
I could make a fist
Oh, we could make this hurt
Or we could make it better
With these two hands
I can tear down walls
I can build a bridge
I can break my fall
With these two hands
I can pray or fight
I can hold the torch
I can shine a light
With these two hands
Wipe the teardrops from your eyes
Reach up until we touch the sky
Free to dream and make it true
No, there ain't nothing we can't do
Oh, there ain't nothing we can't do

What would you do if I sang out of tune
Would you stand up and walk out on me
Lend me your ears and I'll sing you a song
I'll try not to sing out of key
Oh, I'll get by with a little help from my friends
Yes, I'll get high with a little help from my friends
I'm gonna try with a little help from my friends
What do I do when my love - she's away
(Does it worry you to be alone)
How do I feel by the end of the day
(Are you sad becaouse you're on your own
Oh, I'll get by with a little help from my friends
Yes, I'll get high with a little help from my friends
I'm gonna try with a little help from my friends

Do you need anybody
I just need somebody to love
Could it be anybody
I want somebody to love
Could you believe in the love at first sight
Yes, I'm certain it happens all the time
What do you see when you turn off the light
I can't tell you but I'm sure I feel nice
Oh, I'll get by with a little help from my friends
Yes, I'll get high with a little help from my friends
I'm gonna try with a little help from my friends
Do you need anybody

Call it social commentary
Call it just what me eyes see
Seems that there's more pretty women
Than there are fish in the sea
...Woman in love
You see there's girls who like your money
Girls who like your car
Girls who like to sip champagne
And feed on caviar
...Woman in love
Send me some silk stockings
Smooth talking lipstick and curls
I want a woman
More than a girl
Need some lip-locking, cool walking
Diamonds and pearls
I'll wrap 'em all up
And give them the world
You know there ain't no woman
Like a woman in love
Ain't nothing
She can't rise above
She can part the water
When the seas get rough
But there ain't no woman
Like a woman in love
If lust is just a dirty dog
I've been scratching with the fleas
I've been waking up your neighbours
Barking up your tree
I went down to the shopping mall
To get it off my mind
But it's like sleeping with the enemy
If you're not deaf and blind
I tried to run
But it was too late for me
I tried to hide
Since the day Adam met Eve
Till I turned on the television
And I looked up on the screen
I saw a hundred pretty girls
Sing this song on MTV
Send me some silk stockings
Smooth talking lipstick and curls
I want a woman
More than a girl
Need some lip-locking, cool walking
Diamonds and pearls
I'll wrap 'em all up
And give them the world
You know there ain't no woman
Like a woman in love
Ain't nothing she can't rise above
She can part the water
When the seas get rough
There ain't no woman
Like a woman in love
There ain't secret
To woman in love
You think that you can
Live without 'em
But you're asking too much
You see I've slept with romance
And danced with lust
But there ain't no woman
Like a woman in love
Oh, yeah
I've traveled all around the world
Across the seven seas
Got everything I wanted
There's just one thing I need
It hasn't changed forever
Fathers tell your sons
That there ain't nothing like
A thing called love
You know there ain't no woman
Like a woman in love
Ain't nothing she can't rise above
She can part the water
When the seas get rough
There ain't no woman
Like a woman in love
There ain't secret
To woman in love
You think that you can
Live without 'em
But you're asking too much
You see I've slept with romance
And danced with lust
But there ain't no woman
Like a woman in love
Oh, yeah

Música Original de Pee Wee King, Redd Stewart, Chilton Price - Cantada Por Benny Carter
See the pyramids along the Nile
See the sunrise on a tropic isle
Just remember all the while
That you belong to me
See the market place in old Algiers
Send me postcards and souvenirs
Just remember 'till the sun appears
You belong to me
And I'll be alone without you
Maybe you'll be lonesome, too
And blue
Fly the oceans in a silver plane
See the forests that are wet with rain
Just remember 'til you're home again
That you belong to me
Well I'll be alone without you
Maybe you'll be lonesome, too
And blue
See the ocean from a silver plane
See the forests that are wet with rain
Just remember 'til you're home again
You belong to me

You can lose at cards...
You can lose your keys...
You can lose the house or lose the lease...
You can lose your car, you can lose the race...
You can lose your mind or lose your faith...
Take a look around and hear what I've gotta say:
You can't lose at love.
No, you can't lose at love
You can't lose at love...
You can't lose at love...
Chose anything you can dream of
No, you can't lose at love.
We could lose the plot
Or we could lose our way
But I ain't going to lose
These ain't good games we're playing
Let me make you an offer too good to refuse
No, you can't lose at love
No, you can't lose at love
You can't lose at love
You can't lose at love
Chose anything you can dream of
But you can't lose at love
Now we just might roll a seven, these ain't loaded dice
We'll never get to heaven from this driveway tonight
You've heard a million promises that's never come through
Baby I'm telling you we're due
You can't lose at love
You can't lose at love
Chose anything you can dream of
But baby, you can't lose at love
Take a chance on me
Cause you can't lose at love
Take a chance on me
No, you can't lose at love
Take a chance on me
You can't lose at love
No, you can't lose at love
You can't lose at love
You can't lose
You can't lose.

Set me free why don't you baby
Get out of my life why don't you baby
'Cause you don't really love me
You just keep me hangin' on
Why do you keep comin' around
Playing with my heart
Why don't you get out of my life
And let me make a new start
Let me get over you
The way you've gotten over me
You say although we broke up
You still wanna be just friends
But how can we be friends
When seeing you only breaks my heart again
You claim you still care for me
But your heart and soul need to be free
Now that you've got your freedom baby
You wanna still hold onto me
You don't want me for yourself
So let me find somebody else
Why don't you be a man about it
And set me free
You don't care a thing about me
You're just using me
So get out get out get out of my life
And let me sleep at night
'Cause you don't really love me
You just keep me hangin' on

You're dancing with your shadow
You been talking in your sleep
Well you can walk on water
But don't want to wet your feet
You really got me
You really got me now
You know I don't know how you do it
But you really put me through it
You got me
You say you talk to everyone
Who is anyone in town
But they don't recognize you
With your foot out of your mouth
You really got me
You really got me now
You know I don't know how you do it
But you really put me through it
You got me
Who am I to judge a man
Who says he's his own biggest fan
It's true
You brought a knife out to a gunfight
And you're shouting that I'm dead
My old friends Smith and Wesson
Think you're in over your head
You really got me
You really got me now
You know I don't know how you do it
But you really put me through it
You got me

She was a fast machine she kept her motor clean
She was the best damn woman that I ever seen
She had the sightless eyes telling me no lies
Knocking me out with those American thighs
Taking more than her share
Had me fighting for air
She told me to come, but I was already there
'Cause the walls start shaking
The earth was quaking
My mind was aching
And we were making it
And you shook me all night long
Yeah, you shook me all night long
Working double time on the seduction line
She's one of a kind, she's just mine, all mine
Wanted no applause it's just another course
Made a meal outta me
And come back for more
Had to cool me down to take another round
Now I'm back in the ring to take another swing
'Cause the walls were shaking the earth was quaking
My mind was aching
And we were making it
And you shook me all night long
Yeah, you shook me all night long
It knocked me out I said you
Shook me all night long
You had me shaking and you
Shook me all night long
Yeah, you shook me
When you took me

All right, these are all new songs
We didn't wanna, you know, trot out the same old bollocks
Might be a good idea just to bring to this
Extraordinary shining country some new songs
Lift you up, not that you need us to lift us up
Thank you for lifting us up
Joe Strummer used to lift me up
When I was a kid listening to punk rock records
The Clash were our favorite group
And this is the last song that he ever wrote
With his wife Louise, and Elijah his daughter are here too
And I'm singing it for them too
I want you to sing it with me
It's a long (long)
It's a long walk, long walk to freedom
It's a long walk, long walk to freedom
When freedom rises from the killing floor
No lock of iron or rivet can restrain the door
And no kind of army can hope to win a war
It's like trying to stop the rain or still the lion's roar
It's a long walk, long walk to freedom
It's a long walk, long walk to freedom
It's like trying to stop the whirlwind scattering seeds and spores
Like trying to stop the tin cans rattling jailhouse semaphore
Like laying when your spins are manacled its your spirit that gets raw
It's not the small little patch of sky you see, but the spirit it, it soars
And long walk, long walk to freedom
It's a long walk, long walk to freedom
My Man, Adbul Jamaica
When freedom arise from the killing floor
Can't stop the rain nor lions that roar
No matter whirlwind, scatter seeds and spore
From the sky, world visions of poor
Six waves come, then seventh break shore
We don't wanna distant, when you a killa boar
What I'm trying to say, this thing gone high, yay
What's in store, what's in store
Sing this one:
4-6-6 6-4
4-6-6 6-4
4-6-6 6-4
4-6-6 6-4
4-6-6 6-4
In the ghettos of the colors don't forget the human core
In townships of humanity there would be no poor
From when the rock is heavy comes the purest ore
The first six waves might break in the bay, the seventh breaks on the shore
It's a long walk, long walk to freedom
It's a long walk, long walk to freedom
4-6-6 6-4 / It's a long walk
4-6-6 6-4 / Long walk to freedom
4-6-6 6-4 / It's a long walk
4-6-6 6-4 / Long walk to freedom
It's a long walk, long walk to freedom
4-6-6 6-4 / It's a long walk
4-6-6 6-4 / Long walk to freedom
It's a long walk, long walk to freedom
Sing with me
It's a long walk, long walk to freedom
It's a long walk, long walk to freedom
It's a long walk, long walk to freedom
It's a long walk, long walk to freedom
It's a long walk, long walk to freedom
It's a long walk, long walk to freedom
It's a long walk, long walk to freedom
It's a long walk, long walk to freedom
It's a long walk, long walk to freedom
It's a long walk, long walk to freedom
It's a long walk, long walk to freedom
It's a long walk, long walk to freedom
Not just a president for South Africa
Not just a president for Africa
This is a president for anyone, anywhere
Who knows freedom

I gotta go!
I believe in a celebration
I believe we can be free.
I believe you can loose these chains
I believe you can dance with me, dance with me.
Shake! Shake!
Shake! Shake!
I believe in the Third World War
I believe in the atomic bomb.
I believe in the powers-that-be
But they won't overpower me.
And you can go there too,
And you can go, go, go, go!
Shake! Shake!
Shake! Shake!
And we don't have the time
And everything goes round and round
And we don't have the time
To watch the world go tumbling down.
I believe in the bells of Christchurch
Ringing for this land.
I believe in the cells of Mountjoy
There's an honest man.
And you can go there too, etc.
I believe in the walls of Jericho
I believe they're coming down.
I believe in this city's children
I believe the trumpet's sound.

If you’re looking for a night out on the town
You just found me
A freak like me needs company
I’m a 65 million dollar circus tragedy
A freak like me needs company
I’m not rollin’, baby rollin’
In the green but I’m unique
Freak, a freak, freak
I’m the new coney island
And all the rides are open and free
On me
Freak like me needs company
All the weirdos in the world
Are right here in new york city
All the brazen boys and girls
Dressed to kill without pity
All the weirdos from out of town
And all the freaks always around
All the weirdos in the world
Are here in new york city tonight
Here in new york city tonight
I got a crew of party animal mutants by my side
A freak like me needs company
Demon hairdo evil dressers who just won’t be denied
A freak like me needs company
The crossroads of the roads just need a little tweak
From a freak
I said goodbye to my straight life
‘Cause I love a freak
A freak like me needs company
All the weirdos in the world
Are here right now in new york city
All the brazen boys and girls
Peacocks, posers show no pity
All the weirdos from out of town
And all the freaks always around
All the weirdos in the world
Are here in new york city tonight
Here in new york city tonight
Oh yeah
That’s the boys

I'll meet you where there is no weeping
Your tears are now a stream
I'll meet you where there is no sleeping
But we wake up to dream
This is an invitation
To a high location
From someone who wants to be loved
This is a meditation
On your radio station
If you like it, you can sing along
Ahimsa
Ahimsa

I hear in color, I see in black person and white
I falante age my mirror, but would not answer
I tried speaking, but my language was very thick
Oh oh the baby, I had sufficiently of this if to cagar
Then I looked at my eye, the mirror for my soul,
This life is good, but this ai not rock'n'roll
My head is rockin' and my coil of eyes
My head is rockin' and my coil of eyes
My head is rockin' and my coil of eyes
My head is rockin', rockin,
Bad seed, rye drink is my fuel to fly
Running in reserve, I gave for the easy life a test
I am looking at in my eye, the mirror for my soul,
This life is good, but this ai not rock'n'roll, not
My head is rockin' and my coil of eyes
My head is rockin' and my coil of eyes
My head is rockin' and my coil of eyes
My head is rockin', rockin,
My head is rockin' and my coil of eyes
My head is rockin' and my coil of eyes
My head is rockin' and my coil of eyes
My head is rockin', rockin,
Sex, drugs, and rock'n roll, are all the same you
Girls who dance in the table, doin' arrulho of hoochy
Sticky soils and smokey if lodge I started to lose
I lose looking a girl to slide in this
Then I looked at my eye, the mirror for my soul,
This life is good, but this ai not rock'n'roll, not
This all cool life/Life is good
But this ai not rock'n'roll, not
This life is good, but this ai not rock'n'roll, none not

That pace is too hot to handle
As stories that are too good to be true
You want to join in the action
And do believe it came from you
And then you begin to erect the time
Because who has time to down there?
But in the noise and confusion
You are losing contact with the sound
Of the air waves ...
Check the message in the air waves
Do not let it escape
A lover escorrega in its orbit
To show a path easier
But as an idiot you think that the mission it
We supply the parts that are missing in you
And then you discover that it can not deliver
His world is upside-down
And the noise and confusion
You are losing contact with the sound
Of the air waves ...
Check the message in the air waves
All you need is in the air waves
Oh, do not let it escape ...
Because the time will come / Check the message
When I and you are one / In the air waves
Getting / Check the message
To touch the hearts of all / On the air waves
The time will come / Check the message, in the air waves
When I and you are one / Check the message
Getting / In the air waves
To touch the hearts of all / Check the message

(Check the message, in the air waves)
(The heart is beating, in the air waves)
(Check the message, in the air waves)

Next to it
I was so close to it
I had the universe decoded
And the atom split
I hear you say
My oh my
You know I got no tears to cry
And I got no love left in me now
Just salt in my eye
All because of you
All because of you
All because of you
And time time
Poor man's loud
But the sun is shining up above the cloud
It's not the noise it's the deafening silence
Drowns God out
You say I shout government
But I kicked over to my party friends
You're like the river flowing underground
I can feel you when you're not around
All because of you
All because of you
All because of you
And time time
You said, to all mine
Shut your tiny heart
To humble me
Humble humble yeah
I'm alive I'm being born
I just arrived I'm at the door
Of the place I started out from
I want back inside
All because of you
All because of you
All because of you

City street lights
And the multiple life
But babe you gotta give and go
Cigarette lights
Then my finger alights
I need to be alone
She can take you tonight
She can make you, that's alright
She can break you tonight
Don't misunderstand
Cigarette girls
Cause heaven and world
To be a superman
Open her booths
There must be a bruiser
Drinking all I can
We can take that tonight
We can make them, that's right
We can break them tonight
Don't misunderstand
The light...
Alone in the light
Alone in the light
In the sea of pain
You can take it tonight
She can make you, that's right
She can break you tonight
Don't misunderstand
'Cause they cry and...
Alone in the light
Alone in the light
Alone in the light
In the sea at night
We rode the streets in the morning light
We held our hate in our hands
Alone in the light
Alone in the light
Alone in the light
In the sea at night

Here today
And gone tomorrow
Crack the bone, get to the marrow
To be the bee
And the flower
Before the sweetness turns to sour
What we have we're gonna keep... always
What we've lost we don't need... always
What is it that won't let you sleep... always
Be the arrow
And the target
Put your head over the parapet
Be uncool
Yes, be awkward
And don't look in the obvious place
The soul needs beauty for a soul mate
Get down off your holy cloud... always
God will not deal with the proud... always
Well if you dream then dream out loud... always
Eternally yours... always
I want you
I want you
I want you
(Here she come)
Touching the other side
I wanted to be in love
I wanted to call
(Hey, soon soon)
You say come to know yourself... always
Don't find yourself in someone else... always
And always wear a safety belt... always
Wait for me I'm running late... always
This is the moment that we share... for always
Turn each song into a prayer... always
Now and forever
For always
For always
For always
For always

Alright, yeah, wow
This is a tune Beyonce and us have been working on
It's funny how religious people are sometimes the most judgemental
And anyway, this is a song we wrote it's called American Prayer
It could be anything, Irish Prayer, could be African Prayer
It's just a message to the churches that we really need you
To open your door and give sanctuary and break the stigmatization
That goes with being HIV positive
If God loves you, what's the problem?
And this is the time to finish what we started
And this is no time to dream
This is the room
We can turn off the dark tonight
Maybe then we might see
I wanna know the healing of American Prayer
I wanna know the meaning of American Prayer
I want to believe in American Prayer
But I can hear children screaming American Prayer
This is the ground
That keeps our feet from getting wet
And this is the sky over our head
Remember that, what you see depends on where you stand
And how you jump will tell you where you're gonna land
I wanna know the healing of American Prayer
I wanna know the meaning of American Prayer
I want to believe in American Prayer
But I can hear children screaming American Prayer
Hold on, let's not get tired / Hold on, no no no
Don't kick at the darkness
Make the lights brighter
An African Prayer
This is our African Prayer
I wanna know the healing of an African Prayer
I wanna know the meaning of an African Prayer
I want to believe in an African Prayer
But I can hear children screaming African Prayer
Oh, Quinby, Beyonce... / Bono
How about you babe?

What is it when I just can't get through
What is it when we've nothing left to do
But savor the mess that we tried
What is it when the clock just won't rewind
What is it when our love seems to stop time
I'm telling you
Waving a white flag
Baby got a white flag flying for you baby
Got a white flag, a white flag
Angels too tied to the ground
Angels too tied to the ground
Angels too tied to the ground
And now it's only alive in my head
In my mind
All in my head, in my mind
Angels too tied to the ground
Angels too tied to the ground
Angels too tied to the ground

Wake up
The dawn of another dull day
Take up
Your dreams and on your way
Daylight
Mother stands in the hall
Last night
Head against the wall
When night turns to day
And the children come out to play
Another day
Stop, shake out
They come my way
Boy, salute in a street uniform
Toy, soldier ripped and torn
When night turns to day
And the children come out to play
Another day
Stop, shout
They came my way

Bright morning lights
Wipe the sleep
From another day's eye
Turn away from the wall
And there's nothing at all
Being naked and afraid
In the open space of my bed
I'll be with you now
I'll be with you now
I'll be with you now
We lie on a cloud, we lie
Just as I am
I awoke with a tear on my tongue
I awoke with a feeling of never before
In my sleep, I discovered the one
But she ran with the morning sun
I'll be with you now
I'll be with you now
I'll be with you now
We lie on a cloud, we lie
Another time, another place
We lie
Another child has lost the race
We lie
Another time, another place
We lie
Your time, your place
We lie
Another time, another place
We lie
Another child has lost
We lie
Another time, another place

You don't have to break your heart in two my love
You don't have to play a part, it's you I love
You don't have to hide from yourself
You don't have to be someone else, again
You don't have to rescue me
You don't have to watch me drown
You don't have to give to me
All I want is you
Be there my love
Be there tonight
Be there my love
Be there tonight
You don't have to dress yourself up
Or stay the same
You don't have to smile
If I say smile
You don't have to be the best
You don't have to give me rest
All I want is all you have
Nothing else
Nothing
Be there my love
Just be there my love
Oh.. mmm...
If you want the whole of me
That's all you'll get
I sing this song
I'd give my health, give it all
You don't have to -
(Ah, she whispered, she said 'I need you now')
(Ah, she said 'don't worry, please me now')
You don't have to worry, have to worry
If I fall apart
You don't have to wear strings
Or do those things
You're enough in my heart
You don't have to hide from yourself
You don't have to be someone else
All I want is all you have
All I want is you
Be there my love
Be there tonight
Be there my love
Be there tonight
Yes, you all see

Hear the voice of the Bard
Who present, past, and future, sees
Whose ears have heard
The Holy Word
That walk'd among the ancient trees
Calling the lapsed soul
And weeping in the evening dew
That might control
The starry pole
And fallen, fallen light renew
O Earth, O Earth, return
Arise from out the dewy grass
Night is worn
And the morn
Rises from the slumbrous mass
Turn away no more
Why wilt thou turn away
The starry floor

Take me now baby here as I am
Pull me close try an understand
I work all day out in the hot sun
Stay with me now till the mornin' comes
Come on now try and understand
The way I feel when I'm in your hands
Take me now as the sun descends
They can't hurt you now
They can't hurt you now
They can't hurt you now
Because the night belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to us
Because the night belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to us
What I got I have earned
What I'm not I have learned
Desire and hunger is the fire I breathe
Just stay in my bed till the morning comes
Come on now try and understand
The way I feel when I'm in your hands
Take me now as the sun descends
They can't hurt you now
They can't hurt you now
They can't hurt you now
Because the night
Your love is here and now
The vicious circle turns and burns without
Though I cannot live forgive me now
The time has come to take this moment and
They can't hurt you now
Because the night

Six o'clock
On the autoroute
Burning rubber, burning chrome
Bay of Cadiz and ferry home
Atlantic sea cut glass
African sun at last
Lights... flash past...
Like memories
A speeding head, a speeding heart
I'm being born, a bleeding start
The engines roar, blood curling wail
Head first then foot
The heart sets sail

You've been along this road so many times
Nothing should be a surprise to you
Seen every premeditated crime
From every possible point of view
Why, if it's so wrong, does it feel so right
Why, oh I've got your gun
Do I want you tonight
She, she's gonna blow your house down
She's gonna turn your head around
She's gonna blow your house down
What of chaos is the thing you crave
Is it the taste of self-inflicted pain
And what of losing is your drug of choice
Is it what keeps you coming back again
Why, if it's so wrong, does it feel so right
She, she's gonna blow your house down
She's gonna turn your head around
She's gonna blow your house down
She blow your house down
She's gonna turn your head around
She's gonna blow your house down
Run fast, fast as you can
Run fast, fast as you can
Fast, fast as you can
Run as fast, fast as you can
Fast as you can
Run as fast, fast as you can
The wave, it have its
She was saving it
What makes you think you can
Oh, they're craving
Deals for breaking
Your old devil's hands
She, she's gonna blow your house down
She's gonna turn your head around
She's gonna blow your house down
She gonna blow your house down
She's gonna turn your head around
She's gonna blow your house down

I'm in the moon... yeah
All right, let's sing it
No fuel on the car
No money on the car
How we take it away, baby
No moon in the sky
No tile to keep us dry.
See the rain tonight
I have a feeling sick
Coming on me
I tried to paint a portrait
A picture through the clouds for you.
(My, my, my)
Green - your smile
Red - why I made you cry
Gray - this rainy sky
Tomorrow I will be
Blue - Stay love
Keep this evening
This rainy sky
Tomorrow I will be blue
No caffeine in coffee
No sugar in my tea
Only watching TV
With the sound down
None connected Radio
No melody to the music
And the words are wrong
His fingers beating
In rhythm of the rain
His fingers
I tried to paint a picture
A photo over you
(Yeah, my, my, my)

Green - its look cool
Red - why I made you cry
Gray - those days Rainy
Tomorrow I will be
Blue - Stay love
Keep this evening
This rainy sky
Tomorrow I will be blue
I have a feeling sick
Coming on me
I have a feeling sick
I tried to paint a picture
I tried to paint a picture

Tomorrow I will be blue
Oh child
Do not say goodbye

Oh Vanessa holding time with your beautiful eyes of velvet
She dance in the rain, was lost in our games
Turn our backs to the world the night
Sleep in the grass
Stay tuned for passage of the seasons
While the days leading our innocence
We are holding in safety
But we can not open
The summer so early for Vanessa
Oohhh oohhh oooh oohhh
Oohhh oohhh oooh oohhh
Oohhh oohhh oooh oohhh
Oohhh oohhh oooh oohhh
She is beautiful before you start to cry
How many stars reflected in your eye

Boy Falls From Sky
You can change your mind
But you cannot change your heart
It's a compass and a map
The key to the chart
I'd be myself
If I knew I'd become
You can fly too high
And get too close to the sun
See how the boy falls from the sky
Not every wanderer
Is lost or far from home
I didn't have to move so far
To find myself alone
Save, you save yourself
If you even get that right
I used to use a single thread
To cross the sky
And now the eye of the needle
Is your heart denied
The boy falls from the sky
Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhh
The city conducts a symphony
And such soul trash your melody
A single scrap of dignity
In the junkyard of humanity
To hear the voice inside your head
Listen now to no one else
You know exactly what to do
Believe in me
Believe in you
You take a look at my self esteem
And when you do
When you do
Ohhhhhhhhhhh
Believe

Sometimes I scream.

The world is a vampire, sent to drain
Secret destroyers, hold you up to the flames
And what do i get, for my pain
Betrayed desires, and a piece of the game
Even though i know-i suppose i'll show
All my cool and cold-like old job
Despite all my rage i am still just a rat in a cage
Despite all my rage i am still just a rat in a cage
Someone will say what is lost can never be saved
Despite all my rage i am still just a rat in a cage
Now i'm naked, nothing but an animal
But can you fake it, for just one more show
And what do you want, i want change
And what have you got
When you feel the same
Even though i know-i suppose i'll show
All my cool and cold-like old job
Despite all my rage i am still just a rat in a cage
Despite all my rage i am still just a rat in a cage

Despite all my rage i am still just a rat in a cage
Tell me i'm the only one

Been a-doin' my homework all week long
The house is empty, the folks are gone
Ooo c'mon everybody
Well my baby's number one but I'm gonna dance with three or four
And the house'll be shakin' from my bare feet slappin' the floor
When you hear that music you can't sit still
If your brother won't rock you then your sister will
Ooo c'mon everybody
Well we'll really have a party but we gotta put a guard outside
If my folks come home I'm afraid they're gonna have my hide
They'll be no more movies for a week or two
No more runnin' round with the usual crew

Wise men say
Only fools rush in
But I can't help
Falling in love... with you
Shall I stay?
Would it be a sin?
If I can't help
Falling in love... with you
Like a river flows
To the sea
So it goes
Somethings were meant to be
Take my hand
Take my whole life too
'Cause I can't help
Falling in love with you
I can't help
Falling in love...
No I can't help
Falling in love...
No I can't help
Falling in love...

Goodbye Norma Jean
Though I never knew you at all
You had the grace to hold yourself
While those around you crawled
They crawled out of the woodwork
And they whispered into your brain
They set you on the treadmill
And they made you change your name
And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never knowing who to cling to
When the rain set in
And I would have liked to have known you
But I was just a kid
Your candle burned out long before
Your legend ever did
Loneliness was tough
The toughest role you ever played
Hollywood created a superstar
And pain was the price you paid
Even when you died
Oh the press still hounded you
All the papers had to say
Was that Marilyn was found in the nude
Goodbye Norma Jean
From the young man in the 22nd row
Who sees you as something as more than sexual
More than just our Marilyn Monroe

This is one called Cartoon World. I think you know it, Mrs. Brown. Eventually, we will become one. Us, everybody.
Mr. Burk is off to work
He carries papers in his carrier bag
Mr. Postman takes his bag back
Those angry dogs, those angry dogs
It´s a cartoon world
It´s a cartoon world
It´s a cartoon world
It´s a cartoon world
There he is again
Mrs. Brown
You're bigger than me
Mrs. Brown is off to town
To carry shopping in her shopping bag
Mr. Brown is working hard
For some degree at university
A notion
It s a cartoon world
It s a cartoon world
It s a cartoon world
It really is
It s a cartoon world
It s a cartoon world
It s a cartoon
Mrs. Brown lied
Uncle Tony takes a drag
He didn´t give me a lot of beer
Jack and Jill go up the hill
Jack and jill
To pick some flowers and not some bills
It´s a cartoon world
It´s a cartoon world
It´s a cartoon world
It´s a cartoon world
It´s a cartoon world

It's Christmas
Baby, please come home

(Yeah!)

The snow's coming down
I'm watching it fall
Watching the people around
Baby please come home

The church bells in town
They're ringing a song
What a happy sound
Baby please come home

They're singing deck the halls
But it's not like Christmas at all
I remember when you were here
And all the fun we had last year

Pretty lights on the tree
I'm watching 'em shine
You should be here with me
Baby please come home

Baby please come home
Baby please come home

They're singing deck the halls
But it's not like Christmas at all
I remember when you were here
And all the fun we had last year

If there was a way
I'd hold back these tears
But it's Christmas day
Baby please come home
Ohh...

Baby please come home
Baby please come home
Baby please come home
Ohh...
Baby please come home
Baby please come home

Some graphitti was written up on a wall not too far from here
It says coexist
Jesus, Jew, Mohammed, it's true
Jesus, Jew, Mohammed, it's true
All sons of Abraham
Father Abraham, Father Abraham
Where are you now
Father Abraham, look what you've done
You've pitted your son against your son
Father, Father Abraham
No more, no more, no more
No more, no more, no more
No more, no more, no more

I'm tired, so tired I can hardly stand
I can't breathe in the air in this city tonight
It's taken everything I had to give
And now, I just want to get out of here
But I won't be sorry if you won't be
And I don't want your pity or sympathy
But for forty five dollars I can make it
You wait and see
He came from miami to start out again
I hear that he's back with his mother ill
He told me he loved me and he wanted my child
But you know people change their minds
But I won't be sorry if you won't be
And I don't want your pity or sympathy
But with forty five dollars I can make it
You wait and see
But I won't be sorry if you won't be
And I don't want your pity or your sympathy
But with forty five dollars I can make it
You wait and see
It isn't as if I was just anybody
On broadway I danced for that senator
They know me in london and they know me in paris
I'm only talking because you look like you needed a friend
But I won't sorry if you won't be
And I don't want your pity or your sympathy
But with forty five dollars
I'm halfway to miami

Sail through your room

Hey, be my friend
Stay 'til the end
Don't walk away

Don't talk that way
Don't feel my lover say
Hey, hey, hey...

Forward yesterday
Makes me wanna stay
What they said was real
Makes me wanna steal
Livin' under house
Guess I'm livin', I'm a mouse
All's I gots is time
Got no meaning, just a rhyme
Take time with a wounded hand
'Cause it likes to heal
Take time with a wounded hand
'Cause I like to steal
Take time with a wounded hand
'Cause it likes to heal,
I like to steal
I'm half the man I used to be
Because I feel as the dawn
It fades to gray
Well, I'm half the man I used to be
Because I feel as the dawn
It fades to gray
Well, I'm half the man I used to be
Because I feel as the dawn
It fades to gray
Well, I'm half the man I used to be,
Half the man I used to be
Feelin' uninspired
Think I'll start a fire
Everybody run
Bobby's got a gun
Think you're kinda neat
Then she tells me I'm a creep
Friends don't mean a thing
Guess I'll leave it up to me
Take time with a wounded hand
'Cause it likes to heal
Take time with a wounded hand
Guess I like to steal
Take time with a wounded hand
'Cause it likes to heal,
I like to steal
I'm half the man I used to be
Because I feel as the dawn
It fades to gray
I'm half the man I used to be
Because I feel as the dawn
It fades to gray
I'm half the man I used to be
Because I feel as the dawn
It fades to gray
I'm half the man I used to be,
Half the man I used to be
Take time with a wounded hand
'Cause it likes to heal
Take time with a wounded hand
Guess I like to steal
Take time with a wounded hand
'Cause it likes to heal,
I like to steal
I'm half the man I used to be

I know you're so sad
So sad you can't cry
But i know you let go
Although you can't remember why

Your lipstick don't fit
Your strap's coming loose
You're out in the hall
Waltzing the blues

Now you hurt somewhere
They won't find a bruise
You've been learning to walk
In those dancin' shoes

I had a mama
She told me 'bout you
She said true love don't lie
You touch that woman
And the smoke won't leave your eyes

You're talking, you walk
'cause you can't refuse
Learning to walk
In those dancin' shoes

Now you hurt somewhere
They won't find a bruise
Learning to walk

You can dance
You can jive
Having the time of your live
See that girl
Watch that scene
Look at the dancing queen
Friday night and the lights go down
Looking for a place to go
Where they touch the right music, entering in the swing
You come find a king
Anybody could be that guy
The night is beggining end the music is high
With a bit of rock, everything is OK
And you are ready for a dance
When you have the chance
You are the dancing queen, young and sweet
Only 17
Dancing queen and you feel the tamborim
You can dance, you can jive
Having the time of your life
See that girl, watch that scene
Look at the dancing queen

I stopped myself
Gomenasai for everything
Gomenasai, I know I let you down
Gomenasai till the end
I never needed a friend

What I thought was a dream
A mirage
Was as real as it seemed
A privilege
When I wanted to tell you
I made a mistake
I walked away

Oh, I could hide 'neath the wings
Of the bluebird as she sings
The six o'clock alarm would never ring
But it rings and I rise
Wipe the sleep out of my eyes

Cheer up, Sleepy Jean
Oh, what can it mean

As a white knight on a steed
Now you know how happy I can be
Oh, and our good times start and end
Without dollar one to spend

Angel, everything's gonna be alright.
Angel, everything's gonna work out tonight.
Thirteen years old
Sweet as a rose
Every petal of her wafer thin.
Love will make you blind
Creep up from behind
Get you jumping out of your skin
Angel, it's sink or swim.
Deep in the heart
Deep in the heart of this place.
Deep in the heart
Deep in the heart of this place.
Door is closed behind me now
The window is sealed to shut out the light.
Green as the leaves
And the cure for the nettle sting.
Do your homework it'll work out right.
Deep in the heart
Deep in the heart of this place.
Deep in the heart
Deep in the heart of this place.
The scent of cedar
I can still see her
You can't return to the place you never left.
Angel, we'll make it work out tonight
Angel, I wanna be home tonight.
Door is closed behind me now
The window's sealed, to shut out the light
Green as the leaves the cure for the nettle sting
Do your work and you'll work out right.
Deep in the heart
Deep in the heart of this place.
Deep in the heart

Desert Of Our Love
Alright
Hand of gold in the hot day
In the door and out then
The devil in the night
I feel love's alright
Going in the cold and going in the same
Born in the love with the light again
I believe in the love
I'm up again, alright
Alright
Come there, the darkest love then
All alone in the darkest night
I'm in real love
I feel love in the song
One more verse
Meet me in the door with the desert
In the morning I am
In there in the door, in the
Feeling in the stars and the love
All the love and all in the day
Feeling in my power in my love
Say it's in all the day, all the day
Gonna be in the garden in the sky
Oh yeah
Alright
And the desert of our love
And the desert of our love
And the feeling in the sand
When the poor man then
Go in the door, door feel me
Go inside, kneel down
I feel love in the song
Chorus
Feel in the love, I love ya
Go in the soul
Bird in the sky, bird in the rain
Going the field in my heart
In my sight, believe me
Bird in the song

I met my love by the gas works wall
Dreamed a dream by the old canal
Kissed a girl by the factory wall
Dirty old town
Dirty old town
Clouds a drifting across the moon
Cats a prowling on their beat
Spring's a girl in the street at night
Dirty old town
Dirty old town
Heard a siren from the docks
Saw a train set the night on fire
Smelled the spring on the smoky wind
Dirty old town
Dirty old town
I'm going to make me a good sharp axe
Shining steel tempered in the fire
Will chop you down like an old dead tree
Dirty old town

You do your disappearing act
You do your disappearing act
Silence, I know I could get used to this
Cunning, your scent is something I'm not gonna miss
Exile, it's a small price to pay for bliss
Alone, like the painter's dog without a bone
When there's only one thing you need to own
And that is hunger, hunger itself
I know you'll be convinced
Your mattress ripped, and it is torn to shreds
From all the lovers taken to your beds
They're empty now
And you think that you can love
And you think that you can love
And you think that you can love someone into love
You do your disappearing act
You do your disappearing act
Jealousy, it's not what it's cracked up to be
Envy, gets you where you need to be
Alone, rather the river than your stepping stones
Leave the graveyard 'fore you turn to bones
I'm tragic, you're comedy
Oh, baby doll, the dogs are barking, they need to be fed
All the lepers you let in your head - is it empty now?
Cos you think that you can love
And you think that you can love
And you think that you can love someone into love
You do your disappearing act
You do your disappearing act

Do it yourself

Gamma rays, tidal waves, influenza
There’s so many ways
The human race can take a hit
We’re gonna sink but you can swim
If you don’t mind a little change of skin
Designer genes are a better fit
‘Cause we can be what we wanna be
And we need to be what we gotta be
And that’s what we oughta be
In the diy world
Cause we can be what we wanna be
Tomorrow belongs to the brave
And we need to be what we gotta be
Not the slave but the brave
Do it yourself
Do it yourself
Diy world
Rising seas, no more trees
Then be a freaking fleet of killer bees
We’re masters of creation
Dna is the way
Now that evolution’s had its day
The intelligent design solution
And we, we could live for a thousand years
‘Cause we can be what we wanna be
And we need to be what we gotta be
That’s what we oughta be
In the diy world
Cause we can be what we wanna be
Do it yourself
And we need to be what we gotta be
Yourself, do it yourself
That’s what we oughta be
In the diy world
Do it yourself
Do it yourself
Do it yourself
‘Cause we can be what we wanna be
Tomorrow belongs to thte brave
Not the slave
And we need to be what we gotta be
But the brave
Do it yourself
Do it yourself
Diy world
Imagine, we could produce super-strength
Electric reflexes
Powers once reserved for the ancient gods
Are now within our grasp
And we, we could live
We could live for a thousand years

Various lead singers = Normal, Bono = Bold]
It's Christmastime
There's no need to be afraid
At Christmastime
We let in light and we banish shade
And in our world of plenty
We can spread a smile of joy
Throw your arms around the world at Christmastime
But say a prayer
Pray for the other ones
At Christmastime
It's hard, but when you're having fun
There's a world outside your window
And it's a world of dread and fear
Where the only water flowing is
The bitter sting of tears
And the Christmas bells that ring there
Are the clanging chimes of doom
Well tonight thank God it's them instead of you
And there won't be snow in Africa this Christmastime
The greatest gift they'll get this year is life
Where nothing ever grows
No rain nor rivers flow
Do they know it's Christmastime at all?
Here's to you / Raise a glass for everyone
Here's to them / Underneath that burning sun
Do they know it's Christmastime at all?
Feed the world
Feed the world
Feed the world
Let them know it's Christmastime again
Feed the world
Let them know it's Christmastime again

Could I help 'em only standing
Could I be the one to do

Doctor, doctor
What ??? you

Where the sun burns burns bold and
All he ever [track "skips"] next to you

[Music fades out, then back in]

Any wanna gonna man of wanna buy a taking you down
I was thinking of you
Round about wanna gonna say

Any other bonna down a on ya all the time that you wanted
I was all in the grave...I was down the ground

(feat with Andrea Corr)
You're everything I could want
There's no house you couldn't haunt
You're the key that could keep me in
You're the sense, under the skin
I won't bring you roses
I'll bring myself instead
Time only is time
For what is meant
Not what was said
Don't come knocking, don't come knocking
Don't come knocking at my door
Don't come knocking, knock, knock, knocking
Don't come knocking no more
You're a dream I could wake up in
You're a fight I shouldn't try to win
You're the door, I'll always leave open
You're the heart that's always hopin'
Off a tree-lined avenue, in a college made of stone
I'll sit there not dreaming, I would rather live alone
Don't come knocking, don't come knocking
Don't come knocking at my door
Don't come knocking, knock, knock, knocking
Don't come knocking no more
All the stars in the sky
They can't light our way, oh no
All the maps, and all the charts
All the dreams…
Dreams …won't… leave… you…
Home…
Home…
Don't come knocking, don't come knocking
Don't come knocking at my door
Don't come knocking, don't come knocking
Don't come knocking at my door
Don't come knocking, knock, knock, knocking
Don't come knocking no more

I can't be your weather
Cuz' if it rains then it rains
I can't be your lover
Cuz' the feelings would change
I can't be the wind
Cuz' the wind blows too free
But if you want a true companion
Don't forget about me
Don't forget about me
When your heart's in the shade
When there's no one to hold you
And you've fallen from grace
When the spotlights come blind you
And you can no longer see
I'll be right there beside you
Don't forget about me
Friends never leave you
They're a two way street
They'll always believe in you
When you've ceased to believe
And I'll still feel the same
If you're a friend in need
Cuz', I'll always love you
Don't forget about me
Don't forget about me
When your heart's in the shade
When there's no one to hold you
And you've fallen from grace
When the spotlights come blind you
And you can no longer see
I'll be right there beside you
Don't forget about me
Don't forget about me
When your heart's in the shade
When there's no one to hold you
And you've fallen from grace
When the spotlights come blind you
And you can no longer see
I'll be right there beside you
Don't forget about me
Don't forget about me

In this proud land we grew up strong
We were wanted all along
I was taught to fight, taught to win
I never thought I could fail
No fight left or so it seems
I am a man whose dreams have all deserted
I've changed my face, I've changed my name
But no one wants you when you lose
Don't give up 'cause you have friends
Don't give up, you're not beaten yet
Don't give up, I know you can make it good
Though I saw it all around
Never thought I could be affected
Thought that we would be last to go
It's so strange the way things turn
Drove the night toward my home
The place that I was born, out on the lakeside
As daylight broke I saw the earth
The trees had burned down to the ground
Don't give up, you still have us
Don't give up, we don't need much of anything
Don't give up 'cause somewhere there's a place where we belong
Rest your head, you worry too much
It's going to be all right
When times get rough you can fall back on us
Don't give up, please don't give up
Got to walk out of here
I can't take any more
Going to stand on that bridge
Keep my eyes down below
Whatever may come
Whatever may go
That river's flowing
That river's flowing
Don't give up 'cause you have friends
Don't give up, you're not the only one
Don't give up, there's no reason to be ashamed
Don't give up, you still, you still have us
I believe, you and me
That somewhere there's a place where we belong
Af-ri-ca
Af-ri-ca

A young boy named Billy Joe, restless on the farm
A boy filled with wanderlust, who never really meant no harm
He changed his clothes and he shined his boots
And he combed his dark hair down
But his mama cried as he walked out:
'Don't take your guns to town
Don't take your guns to town
Don't take your guns... to town'
He laughed and kissed his mom and said 'Your Billy Joe he's the man
I can shoot as quick, I can shoot as straight, as anybody, can
But I wouldn't shoot, without a cause, or gun nobody down'
But she cried again as he rode away:
'Don't take your guns to town
Son, leave your guns at home
Don't take your guns to town'
Well he drank his first strong liquor then to calm his shaking hands
And he tried, he tried to tell himself at last he had become a man
But a dusty cowpoke stood at his side, began to laugh him down
And he heard again his mother's words:
'Don't take your guns to town
Son, leave your guns at home
Don't take your guns...'
Don't take your guns....
Don't take your guns to town
Don't take your guns....
Don't take your guns to town
Filled with rage then Billy Joe reached for his gun to draw
But the stranger drew his gun and fired before he even saw
As Billy Joe fell to the floor the crowd all gathered around
And wondered at his final words:
'Don't take your guns to town
Son, leave your guns at home
Don't take your guns to town'

My eyes are black
They've seen the glory
My ears are shut
They've heard the storm
My legs are weak
From so much stumbling
Down all the days
Down all the days
My lips are dry
They've tasted water
My spirit high
I hardly touch the ground
My heart is heavy
It hears the distant firing
Down all the days
Down all the days
Down all the days
Down all the days
Down all the days
Days, days
Down all the days
Days, days
I love to talk
Days, days
Can you leave me some it to hug
Days, days
Can you hold me now
Days, days
I love her hug
Days, days
Days, days
Days
The skyline's in the cloud
Throw down some winds now
Right now I'm only here to see me
Come down whenever you want to see me
Right on a phone, the holy rose
Someone in the street's on fire
And I am weary, worthy
Wounded, all wrong
I love thee, to hold thee
I love thee

My heart is longing for you, love
I cared for you more then you knew
Though you have broken each promise
And yesterday's dreams are untrue
Alone, I'll be yearning tomorrow
When sunshine brings memories of you
My sunshine will turn into sorrow
As I dream of the love we once knew
Why should I always be lonesome
When sunny and blue are the skies
While shadows and loneliness linger
I'm dreaming with tears in my eyes
Why did you promise me sweetheart
Never to leave me alone
Yesterday's sunshine is faded
Your love wasn't true like my own
Alone, I'll be yearning tomorrow
When sunshine brings memories of you
My sunshine will turn into sorrow
As I dream of the love we once knew
Why should I always be lonesome
When sunny and blue are the skies
While shadows of loneliness linger
I'm dreaming with tears in my eyes

I met her up on Leeson Street of a Tuesday afternoon
In Summer's fallen colours, sulking back to school
I asked her would she linger, I asked her would she stay
Would she keep a man in company, drinking in the day?
Drinking, Drinking
Drinking... not thinking
Drinking, Drinking
We'll go drinking in the day
She was almost a woman, she was going on sixteen
She asked me to go walking, In Saint Stephen's Green
She said I love the sunshine, and to hear the children play.
But I won't be distracted when I'm drinking in the day.
With her flashing eyes and milk white lies she looked like a song
Like the ghost of a woman that first made me go wrong
She said I'll have a drink with you I said you'll have to pay
For a comprehensive education
Drinking in the day
Drinking, Drinking
Drinking and not thinking
Drinking, Drinking
We'll go drinking in the day
If her mother could have seen us on that bright September day
Botticelli and his angel perambulating Ormand Quay
A drunken blessed virgin, me rhetorious and gay
Bestowing ancient wisdom as to what made me this way
Deny your friends and family
To serve you must betray
Break and enter heaven
S teal but never save
Squander every penny
Empty every heart
Travel every darkened road
Never finish what you start
Always talk to strangers
Make love with whom you may
For God will find good company
for your drinking in the day
Drinking, drinking
Drinking and not thinking
Drinking, drinking
We'll go drinking in the day
So spend your youth on poetry, and spend your cash at play
Each line upon my face is for a girl who went away
A kiss, a song, are fleeting things and fame will always stray
So I'll tell the truth, the best spent youth, is the one you give away
Drinking, drinking
Drinking... not thinking
Drinking, drinking
We'll go drinking in the day
Drinking, drinking
Drinking... not thinking
Drinking, drinking
We'll go drinking in the day
Drinking, drinking
Drinking... not thinking
Drinking, drinking
We'll go drinking in the day
Drinking, drinking
Drinking... not thinking
Drinking, drinking
We'll go drinking in the day
Drinking, drinking
Drinking... not thinking
Drinking, drinking
We'll go drinking in the day
Drinking, drinking
Drinking... not thinking
Drinking...

Merry Christmas. This is Bono the singer with U2.
This is a poem I'd like to, recite for you by another Irishman, John F. Dean
It's about driving to midnight mass in Dublin on Christmas Eve:
Five-thousand million years ago, this earth lay heaving in a mass of rocks and fire
Wasting, burdened with its emptiness
Tonight, when arthropods and worms and sponges have given way to dinosaurs
And dinosaurs to working, wandering apes
Homo erectus have given way to sapiens, and he to
Homo sapiens sapiens (alias Paddy Mack)
Look down on Dublin from the hills around
And lights could be a million Christmas trees
Still firs standing, while in the sky a glow as if of dawn
This day a light shall shine on us
The Lord is born within our city
Look along to the river toward O'Connell Bridge
The lights, the neon signs, all stream on water like breathed-on strips of tinsel
All is still...
Eleven-thirty, pubs begin to empty
Men stop to argue, sway and say the name of Jesus
For those who have known darkness
Who have now seen a wonderous light
Those who have dwelt on unlit streets
To them the light has come
Tonight, few cars go by
The blocks of flats with windowed-plastic trees
And fairy lights stand, watching for a miracle
Here are no dells where fairies might appear
Out from the dark an ambulance comes speeding
Sickly blue lights search in siren-still
The mystery of the night ticks slowly on
It will pass and leave memories of friends and small, half-welcomed things
In Him was life
In Him, life was the light of man
For neither prehistoric swans nor trilobites, the mesozoic birds
Neanderthal, nor modern man had ever dreamt or seen what was our God
The shops are gay with lights and bright things
All save funeral homes, they dare not advertise their presence
As midnight peels and organs start to play
Two cars meet headlong in a haze of drink
The crash flicks into silence
Pain crawls like a slime through blood and into limbs
God is revealed, a baby naked, crying in a crib
In the church porches and out along the grounds
Teenagers laugh and swear, smokin', watchin' girls
So, once more, Christmas trails away
Its meaning moves back into the mist and the march of time

America
America, I've given you all and now I'm nothing
America, two dollars and twenty-seven cents January 17, 1956
I can't stand my own mind
America, when will we end the human war
Go fuck yourself with your atom bomb
I don't feel good, don't bother me
I won't write my poem till I'm in my right mind
America, when will you be angelic
When will you take off your clothes
When will you look at yourself through the grave
When will you be worthy of your million Trotskyites
America, why are your libraries full of tears
America, when will you send your eggs to India
I'm sick of your insane demands
When can I go into the supermarket and buy what I need with my good looks
America, after all, it is you and I who are perfect, not the next world
Your machinery is too much for me
You made me want to be a saint
There must be some other way to settle this argument
Burroughs is in Tangiers
I don't think he'll come back, it's sinister
Are you being sinister or is this some form of practical joke
I'm trying to come to the point
I refuse to give up my obsession
America, stop pushing, I know what I'm doing
America, the plum blossoms are falling
I haven't read the newspapers for months
Everyday somebody goes on trial for murder

Oh, wrap me in my country's flag, and lay me in the
cold blue sea
Let the roaring of the waves, my solemn requiem be
And I shall sleep a pleasant sleep, while storms above
their vigils keep
My Captain brave shall read for me, the service of the
silent dead
And yay shall lower me in the waves, when all the
prayers are said
And I will find my long, long home, among the billows
and the foam
Farewell my friends for many a league, we've sailed
together on the deep
Come let us shake our hands, I'll sail no more, but
shipmates wear for weep
I'm bound above, my course is run
I near the port, my voyage is done.

(Black flash)
Black flash over my own love
Tell me of my eyes
Black flash come though my own life
Telling these things
And I believe them
And I believe in you
White flash sees the sky
And it turns its side from you
She won't turn my back
And I know you turn so blue
And you know
And your sky is feeling blue
And your heart
So cold when I'm with you
And you feel
Like no one told you to
And your time is your side
And your time with me
Ah, don't talk to me
Ah, don't talk to me
Don't talk to me
You know
Like no one told you how
But you know
Though the king that howls has howled
But you feel like sentimental
But you don't care
If I just share it in your heart
(Heart...)
Hopelessly
So hopelessly
I'm breaking through for you and me
And you don't
Though no one told you to
And you found out
Where you were going, where to
You're through with me
But I know that you will be back
For more
And you know
And though no one told you so
And you know, blue sky
Like a harder shade of blue
And you walk
When you want
To let go
Me, I'm the outside, tell me fade away
Drop me down but don't break me
In your sleep
In your sleep, inside
It's in your heart and mine
Whole sea is dark
It's in your heart and mine
Sweetly, those will come
Loving is on your side walking through
So let me in your heart
Your beat is like something...
They...
Run...
See say you're sad and reach by
So say you're sad above beside
Oh stay sad above beside
So stay sad above we said
You know I don't
No one told you how
(And you don't)
(And you wipe sweat off your white brow)
And you care
And no one told you tried
And your heart
Is left out from the side
And the rain beats down
And the shame goes down
And this rain keeps on coming down
And this sky
Tonight...
You know "S" "O" "N" "G", why
You're going go join to God
You know "S" "O" "N" "G", why
Give away some him no lie
Give away some my de day no
You know
And though no one told you sky
And you feel
Like you pretend you can
You say go, you live
Go live outside of me
Don't you leave
Don't leave out part of me
Then I can feel
Like I feel before
Like I hurt now
And I see the floor
If you pick me up
Bits and pieces on this floor

Once I had fame
I was full of pride
Well, there were a lot of friends
Always by my side
But my luck ran dry
Now my friends begin to hide
Everybody loves a winner
Everybody loves a winner
When you lose, you lose alone
Everywhere I turned
There was a hello and a smile
I never thought they'd be gone
After a while
Oh, that big road ran down
And the smiles turned to frowns
Everybody loves a winner
Everybody loves a winner
But when you lose, you lose alone
Hands to heaven that I would be true
To get back that love
There's nothing I wouldn't do
But I learned and I lost
And now I paid the cost
Everybody loves a winner
Everybody loves a winner
Everybody loves a winner
But when you lose, you lose alone

Every chip from every cup
Every promise given up
Every reason that's not enough
Is falling, falling at your feet…
Every band elastic limit
Every race when there's nothing in it
Every winner that has lost their ticket
Is falling, falling at your feet…
I've come crawling, falling at your feet…
Everyone who needs a friend
Every life that has no end
Every knee not ready to bend
Is falling, falling at your feet
I've come crawling, now I'm falling at your feet…
All fall down…
All the manic days
The faces that you pull
All the x-rays not under your control
The graffiti rolling down off of your tongue
And the compromise you make for someone…
Every teenage with acne
Every face that's spoiled by beauty
Every adult tamed by duty
Are all falling at your feet…
Every foot in every face
Every cop stop that finds the grace
Every prisoner in the Maze
Every hand that needs an ace
Is falling, falling at your feet
I've come crawling, now I'm falling at your feet…
All fall down…
All the books you never read
Just started
All the meals you rushed
And never tasted…
Every eye closed by a bruise
Every player who just can't lose
Every pop star hurling abuse
Every drunk back on the booze
All falling at your feet, all falling at your feet…
All fall down…
All the information
All the big ideas
All the radio waves
On electronic seas
How to navigate
How to simply be
Don't know when to wait
Explain simplicity
In whom shall I trust?
How might I be still?
Teach me to surrender
Not my will, THY will…

Calling, calling
The sun is burning black
Calling, calling
It's beating on my back
With a fire
With a fire.
Calling, calling
The moon is running red
Calling, calling
It's pulling me instead
With a fire, fire.
But there's a fire inside
And I'm falling over
There's a fire in me
When I call out
You built a fire, fire
I'm going home.
Calling, calling
The stars are falling down
Calling, calling
They knock me to the ground
With a fire, fire.
But there's a fire inside
And I'm falling over
There's a fire inside
When I call out
There's a fire inside
When I'm falling over
You built a fire, fire
I'm going home.

When I come home baby
And I've been working all night long
I put my daughter on my knee
And she say "Daddy, what's wrong?"
She whisper in my ear so sweet
You know what she says?
She say: daddy you're a fool to cry
You're a fool to cry
And it makes me wonder why
You know I got a woman
And she live in a poor part of town
And I go see her sometimes
And we make love so fine
I put my head on her shoulder
She says, "Tell me all your troubles"
You know what she says?
She say: daddy you're a fool to cry
You're a fool to cry
And it makes me wonder why
She say: daddy you're a fool to cry
Oooo daddy you're a fool to cry
Oooo daddy you're a fool to cry
Oooo daddy you're a fool to cry
Even my friends say to me sometimes
And make out like I don't understand them
You know what they say?
They say Oo daddy you're a fool to cry
You're a fool to cry
And it makes me wonder why
I'm a fool baby

Gotta tell ya baby

Don't believe the devil
I don't believe his book
But the truth is not the same
Without the lies he made up.
Don't believe in excess
Success is to give
Don't believe in riches
But you should see where I live.
I, I believe in love.
Don't believe in forced entry
Don't believe in rape
But every time she passes by
Wild thoughts escape.
Don't believe in Death Row
Skid row or the gangs.
Don't believe in the Uzi
It just went off in my hands.
I, I believe in love.
Don't believe in cocaine
Got a speedball in my head
I could cut and crack you open
Did you hear what I said?
Don't believe them when they tell me
There ain't no cure.
The rich stay healthy
The sick stay poor.
I, I believe in love.
Don't believe in Goldman
His type like a curse
Instant karma's gonna get him
If I don't get him first.
Don't believe that Rock 'n' Roll
Can really change the world
As it spins in revolution
Yeah, it spirals and turns.
I, I believe in love.
Don't believe in the sixties
The golden age of pop
You glorify the past
When the future dries up.
Heard a singer on the radio
Late last night
Says he's gonna kick the darkness
Till it bleeds daylight.
I, I believe in love.
Feel like I'm fallin'
I'm spinnin' on a wheel
It always stops beside a name
A presence I can feel.
I believe in love.
Stop!

See reflections on the water
More than darkness in the depths
See him surface in every shadow
On the wind I feel his breath
Goldeneye
I've found his weakness
Goldeneye
He'll do what I please
Goldeneye
No time for sweetness
But a bitter kiss
Will bring him to his knees
You'll never know
How I watched you from the shadows as a child
You'll never know
How it feels to be the one who's left behind
You'll never know
The days and nights
The tears, the tears I've cried
But now my time has come
And time, time is not on your side
See him move through smoke and mirrors
Feel his presence in the crowd
Other girls, they gather around him
If I had him I wouldn't let him out
Goldeneye
Not lace or leather
Golden chains take him to the spot
Goldeneye
I'll show him forever
It'll take forever to see what I've got
You'll never know
How I watched you from the shadows as a child
You'll never know
How it feels to get so close and be denied
It's a gold and honey trap
I've got for you tonight
Revenge is a kiss
This time I won't miss
Now I've got you in my site
With a goldeneye
Golden, goldeneye
With a goldeneye
Goldeneye
Goldeneye
Goldeneye
Goldeneye

Slow is the memory
I can see it stop in my front
Flores orange crushed in concrete
I walk around, barefoot
Because I know you want me to
I can not remember everything
Your sweat is sweet taste as a stick of sugar
I had been there before coming
My tank is empty
But you are based
I have tried to explain
What I love another person
But I can not bear to hear you cry
I was sick in all those years wasted
A rag for the tears of someone
I would bring out and hang dry pra
And I saw you when I came back
Perhaps we can begin to track the back forward
You touch it because he knows how much I
I think that we need to relax
Because I know you want me to
Every time and everywhere
A superficial happiness but the belly is not there
With the bad things you really should take care
And the gap is too bear pra
I have tried to explain
What I love another person
But I can not bear to hear you cry
I was sick in all those years wasted
A rag for the tears of someone
I would bring out and hang dry pra
Come, come
Turn off the phone
Please go home

I've heard there was a secret chord
That David played to please the Lord
But you don't really care for music, do you
It goes like this: the fourth, the fifth
The minor fall, the major lift
The baffled king composed Hallelujah
Your faith was strong but you needed proof
You saw her bathing on the roof
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew you
She tied you to a kitchen chair
She broke your throne, she cut your hair
And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah
You say I took the Name in vain
Well I don't even know the name
But if I did, well, really, what's it to you
There's a blaze of light in every word
It doesn't matter which you heard
The holy, or the broken Hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah
I did my best, it wasn't much
I couldn't feel, so I learned to touch
I've told the truth, I didn't come to fool you
And even though all went wrong
I'll stand before the Lord of Song
With nothing on my lips but Hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Now maybe there's a God above
But all I ever learned from love
Was how to shoot at someone who outdrew you
And it's no complaint you hear tonight
It's not some pilgrim who's seen the light
It's a cold and broken Hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah

Mother Superior jump the gun
Mother Superior jump the gun

Mother Superior jump the gun
Happiness is a warm gun
Happiness is a warm gun
She's well acquainted with the touch of the velvet hand
Like a lizard on a window pane
The man in the crowd
With the multicoloured mirrors on his hobnail boots
Lying with his eyes wide open
And the hands busy working overtime
A soap impression of his wife which he ate
And donated to the National Trust
Hey, I need a fix 'cause I'm going down
Happiness is a, a warm gun
Happiness is a, a warm gun
Happiness is a, a warm gun
Happiness is a warm gun
Happiness is a warm gun
Happiness is a warm gun
I need a fix cause I'm going down
I need a fix cause I'm going down

Oh, where have you been, my blue-eyed son?
Oh, where have you been, my darling young one?
I've stumbled on the side of twelve misty mountains
I've walked and I've crawled on six crooked highways
I've stepped in the middle of seven sad forests
I've been out in front of a dozen dead oceans
I've been ten thousand miles in the mouth of a graveyard
And it's a hard, and it's a hard, it's a hard, and it's a hard
And it's a hard rain's a-gonna fall
Oh, what did you see, my blue-eyed son?
Oh, what did you see, my darling young one?
I saw a newborn baby with wild wolves all around it
I saw a highway of diamonds with nobody on it
I saw a black branch with blood that kept drippin'
I saw a room full of men with their hammers a-bleedin'
I saw a white ladder all covered with water
I saw ten thousand talkers whose tongues were all broken
I saw guns and sharp swords in the hands of young children
And it's a hard, and it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard
And it's a hard rain's a-gonna fall
And what did you hear, my blue-eyed son?
And what did you hear, my darling young one?
I heard the sound of a thunder, it roared out a warnin'
Heard the roar of a wave that could drown the whole world
Heard one hundred drummers whose hands were a-blazin'
Heard ten thousand whisperin' and nobody listenin'
Heard one person starve, I heard many people laughin'
Heard the song of a poet who died in the gutter
Heard the sound of a clown who cried in the alley
And it's a hard, and it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard
And it's a hard rain's a-gonna fall
Oh, who did you meet, my blue-eyed son?
Who did you meet, my darling young one?
I met a young child beside a dead pony
I met a white man who walked a black dog
I met a young woman whose body was burning
I met a young girl, she gave me a rainbow
I met one man who was wounded in love
I met another man who was wounded with hatred
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard
It's a hard rain's a-gonna fall
Oh, what'll you do now, my blue-eyed son?
Oh, what'll you do now, my darling young one?
I'm a-goin' back out 'fore the rain starts a-fallin'
I'll walk to the depths of the deepest black forest
Where the people are many and their hands are all empty
Where the pellets of poison are flooding their waters
Where the home in the valley meets the damp dirty prison
Where the executioner's face is always well hidden
Where hunger is ugly, where souls are forgotten
Where black is the color, where none is the number
And I'll tell it and think it and speak it and breathe it
And reflect it from the mountain so all souls can see it
Then I'll stand on the ocean until I start sinkin'
But I'll know my song well before I start singin'
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard
It's a hard rain's a-gonna fall

Like a desert needs rain
Like a town needs a name
I need your love.
Like a drifter needs a room
Hawkmoon
I need your love.
I need your love.
Like a rhythm unbroken
Like drums in the night
Like sweet soul music
Like sunlight
I need your love.
Like coming home
And you don't know where you've been
Like black coffee
Like nicotine
I need your love,
I need your love.
When the night has no end
And the day yet to begin
As the room spins around
I need your love
I need your love.
Like a Phoenix rising needs a holy tree
Like the sweet revenge
Of a bitter enemy
I need your love.
Like heat needs the sun
Like honey on her tongue
Like the muzzle of a gun
Like oxygen
I need your love,
I need your love.
When the night has no end
And the day yet to begin
As the room spins around
I need your love
I need your love.
Like thunder needs rain
Like a preacher needs pain
Like tongues of flame
Like a sweet stain
Need your love
I need your love.
Like a needle needs a vein
Like someone to blame
Like a thought unchained
Like a runaway train
Need your love,
I need your love.
Need your love
I need your love.
Like faith needs a doubt
Like a freeway out
Need your love.
Like powder needs a spark
Like lies need the dark
I need your love.

You used to think I was something special
You haven't thought that in a while
You liked the company of my inner devil
'Cause my inner devil could make you smile
Like an angel on some stained-glass
Not some relic from the recent past
With your pale breasts and your fresh wound
And your eyes to heaven with your hands bound
I thought you'd find me when you went looking
In truth, you'd have to be there to look around
How come the honeysuckle isn't sucking
And I got a bee sting walking on the ground
Did our brass bead become a mud bath
A dirty boy, dirty girl having a dirty laugh
I saw you coming, I had you covered
Till you discovered
That we're heaven, heaven, heaven and hell
Heaven, heaven, heaven, heaven and hell
Picnick table and a china cup
We had an airbed that was all stuffed
Now it's room 64 at the chateau
Ask the front desk where does your love go
Is it to heaven, heaven, heaven or to hell
Is it to heaven, heaven, heaven or hell
Baby, we're heaven, heaven, heaven, heaven and hell

Hunters and Prey
Fly from the haze
Jump on the prey
Scaring away
Capture's in vain
Daring the hills
Mountains ahead
Roaming and stare
Lonely again
Perish the heat
Succumbing breath
Last but not least
Die or slay
Hide on the field
Perceiving eyes
Hunting the prey
In paradise
No one is to know
Secrets of your soul
No one knows for sure
Still I wonder why
I'm waiting, just waiting
Answers to return
Don't let your dreams deny you
When it's time to learn
I'm standing, I'm waiting
Time has no reverse
Can someone see them falling
Bones will feed the dirt
Hunters and Prey
You got to run away!

I am he
As you are he
As you are me
And we are all together
See how they run like pigs from a gun
See how they fly
I'm crying
Sitting on a cornflake
Waiting for the van to come
Corporation tee shirt
Stupid bloody tuesday
Man, you've been a naughty boy
You let your face grow long
Refrão
I am the eggman
They are the eggmen
I am the walrus
Goo goo g'joob
Mister city
Policeman sitting
Pretty little
Policemen in a row
See how they fly like lucy in the sky
See how they run
I'm crying (4x)
Yellow matter custard
Dripping from a dead dog's eye
Crab a locker fishwife
Pornographic priestess
Boy, you've been a naughty girl
You let your knickers down
Refrão
Sitting in an english garden, waiting for the sun
If the sun don't come you get a tan
From standing in the english rain
Refrão
Expert texperts choking smokers
Don't you think the joker laughts at you?
See how they smile like pigs in a sty
See how they snide
I'm crying
Semolina pilchard
Climbing up the eiffel tower
Elementary penguin
Singin' hare krishna
Man, you should have seen them
Kicking Edgar Allan Poe
I am the eggman
They are the eggmen
I am the walrus

They said there'll be snow at Christmas
They said there'll be peace on Earth
But instead it just kept on raining
A veil of tears for the Virgin's birth
I remember one Christmas morning
A winters light and a distant choir
And the peal of a bell and that Christmas Tree smell
And their eyes full of tinsel and fire
They sold me a dream of Christmas
They sold me a Silent Night
And they told me a fairy story
'Till I believed in the Israelite
And I believed in Father Christmas
And I looked at the sky with excited eyes
'Till I woke with a yawn in the first light of dawn
And I saw him and through his disguise
I wish you a hopeful Christmas
I wish you a brave New Year
All anguish pain and sadness
Leave your heart and let your road be clear
They said there'll be snow at Christmas
They said there'll be peace on Earth
Hallelujah Noel be it Heaven or Hell
The Christmas you get you deserve.
La la la la la la la la la la....

Say it now, say it now
Explain to me
Why this happens to me every time
Give me any kind of sign
‘Cause I just can’t walk away
You wait
I won’t
I leave
I don’t
I memorize what I have to say
But he doesn’t say it anyway
Say it now, say it now
Explain to me
Why this happens to me every time
Give me a clue or tell me why
I just can’t walk away
Walk, walk away
Walk, walk away
Needing, aching, lying awake
In a room in my heart
A heartbeat away
Yet we’re miles apart
You know that love can’t live
Without honesty
But there are dangers in the daylight
And the shadows with me
Say it now, I wish I could say it now
Say to me the words I need to hear
Why you just don’t disappear
And why I just can’t walk way
Say it now, say it now
Say to me the simple words I fear
I know why I’m here
‘Cause I just can’t walk away
Walk, walk away
Walk, walk away
Walk, walk away
Walk, walk away
Walk, walk away
Walk, walk away
Walk, walk away
Walk, walk away

I was talking, I was talking to myself
Somebody else talk, talk, talking.
I couldn't hear a word, a word he said.
He was my brother
I said there was no other way out of here
Be my brother
(Brother).
Got to get out, got to get out.
I was walking, I was walking into walls
And back again
I just keep walking
I walk up to a window to see myself
And my reflection, when I thought about it
My direction, going nowhere, going nowhere.
No-one, no-one is blinder
Than he who will not see.
No-one, no-one is blinder
Than me.
I was talking, I was talking in my sleep
I can't stop talk, talk, talking
I'm talking to you, it's up to you
Be my brother, there is no other way out of here
Be my brother
Got to get out, got to get out

I have got you under my skin
I've got you deep in the heart of me
So deep in my heart
You're really a part of me
I've got you under my skin
I have tried so not to give in
I have said to myself this affair
Never gonna go so well
But why should I try to resist
When baby I know so well
That I've got you under my skin
I would sacrifice anything
Come what might
For the sake of holding you near
In spite of a warning voice
That comes in the night
And repeats and it shouts in my ear
Don't you know blue-eyes
You never can win
Use your mentality
Wake up to reality
But each time I do
Just the thought of you
Makes me stop before I begin
'cause I've got you under my skin
I'd sacrifice anything
Come what might
For the sake of having you near
In spite of a warning voice
That comes in the night
And repeats and it shouts in my ear
Don't you know you fool
You never can win

But each time that I do
Just the thought of you
Makes me stop before I begin
'cause I've got you under my skin
And I love you (when you're) under my skin

"In the Name of the Father"
Come to me
Come lie beside me
Oh don't deny me
Your love
Make sense of me
Walk through my doorway
Don't hide in the hallway
Oh love...step over
I'll follow you down
I'll follow you down
In the name of whiskey
In the name of song
You didn't look back
You didn't belong
In the name of reason
In the name of hope
In the name of religion
In the name of dope
In the name of freedom
You drifted away
To see the sun shining
On someone else's day
In the name of United and the BBC
In the name of Georgie Best and LSD
In the name of a father
And his wife the spirit
You said you did not
They said you did it
In the name of justice
In the name of fun
In the name of the father
In the name of the son
Call to me
No one is listening
I'm waiting to hear from you love
Stay with me
It's cold in the ground
But there's peace in the sound
Of the white and the black
Spilling over
I'll follow you down
I'll follow you down

Hard to tell or recognise a sign
To see me through, a warning sign
First the thunder
Satisfied
If the past, it will not lie
Then the storm, torn assunder
The future you and i get blown away
In the storm
In a lifetime
In a lifetime
And as the rain it falls, begin again
As the storm breaks through
Heavy in my heart
Believe the light in you
So the light shines in you
Without colour, faded and worn
Torn assunder in the storm
Unless the sound has faded from your soul
Unless it dissapears
First the thunder
Selfish storm
Then the storm
Hold on the inside
Torn assunder
One life
In the storm
In a lifetime
In a lifetime
In a lifetime
In a lifetime

In the forest there's a clearing

If I could I would
Up for air to swim against the tide
Hey, hey, hey
Up towards the sky
It's a blue sky
To lose along the way the spark that set the flame
To flicker and to fade on this the longest day
So wind go through to my heart
So wind blow through my soul
So wind go through to my heart
So wind blow through my soul
So wind go through to my heart
You give yourself to this the longest day
You give yourself, you give it all away
Two rivers run too deep, the seasons change and so do I
The light that strikes the tallest trees the light away for I
The light away, up towards the sky
It's a blue sky
To lose along the way the spark that set the flame
To flicker and to fade on this the longest day
So wind go through to my heart
So wind blow through my soul
So wind go through to my heart
So wind blow through my soul
So wind go through my heart
So wind blow through my soul
So wind go through to my heart
You give yourself to this the longest day
You give yourself, you give it all away

Late at night
When the motion beats down
I feel so low, oh no
I lived a lie
For a thousand years
We start to cower, oh no
I said oh no, baby don't
What you got to do it for
Can't go on
She says oh no, baby don't
Let me take me out here
Thank you man
You can think you're so high
When the moon is way down low
Take your time feel fine
Those ladies are so darn high
Oh no no no
You gamble inside out
Forever inside out

We're in for a line, I can't think to carry on
We're able to chew it, chained for a speaker
And I won't move it, he's gonna have to carry on
I wait for the time when my tunes feel better than life

Who will buy me, look

They shuffle and look, readin' your book
Look in their face, I don't

Cities of concrete and glass

But Jah love

Let freedom pour, let freedom run
Jah love
Let every heart beat as one
We make one step, Jah does the rest
Jah loves everything, that has breath
Cities of concrete and glass

But Jah love
Jah love
Jah love
Steel towers rise, to pierce the sky
While the children, hurt and cry
Jah will wipe away the tears from their eyes
Jah love
Oh Jah love
Jah love
Lift our hearts and free our minds
Jah love
Justice the wonder and a sign
Under the shadow, the eye of the clock
We fight for a future, on this sovereign rock
Cities of concrete and glass
All will turn to sand
None of them will last
But Jah love
Jah love
Jah love / Never fade away
Jah love / Yeah
Dip me in the water
Make me like the land
Glory to our father
His kingdom is at hand
See the living order / Heart, heart, heart, hearts, all hearts, beat as one
Spread over the land / Heart, heart, heart, hearts, all hearts, beat as one
The hearing of the nation / Heart, heart, heart, hearts, all hearts, beat as one
Seat of every man / Heart, heart, heart, hearts, all hearts, beat as one
Dip me in the water / Heart, heart, heart, hearts, all hearts, beat as one

I saw an angel in blue jeans today
I felt that she melted all my bitterness away
You always tried so hard to hide your wings behind your coat
So let it be and let them free
So you can't hoover low above the ground
You look so tired you've got moonbeams in your eyes
And if I believed I know you'd be the first to fly
You always tried so hard to hide your wings behind your coat
So let it be and let them free
So you can't hoover low above the ground
I'll find sunshine sometime soon

Ma jolie, how do you do?
Mon nom est Jean-Guy Thibault-Leroux
I come from east of Gatineau
My name is Jean-Guy, ma jolie
J'ai une maison a Lafontaine
Where we can live, if you marry me
Une belle maison a Lafontaine
Where we will live, you and me
Oh Louise, ma jolie Louise
Tous les matins au soleil
I will work 'til work is done
Tous les matins au soleil
I did work 'til work was done
And one day, the foreman said
"Jean-Guy, we must let you go"
Et pis mon nom, y est pas bon
At the mill anymore...
Oh Louise, I'm losing my head
I'm losing my head
My kids are small, 4 and 3
Et la bouteille, she's mon ami
I drink the rum 'tilI I can't see
It hides the shame Louise does not see
Carousel turns in my head
And I can't hide, oh no, no, no, no
And the rage turned in my head
And Louise, I struck her down
Down on the ground
I'm losing my mind, I'm losing my mind
En Septembre '63
Kids are gone, and so is Louise
Ontario, they did go
Near la ville de Toronto
Now my tears, they roll down
Tous les jours
And I remember the days
And the promises that we made
Oh Louise, ma jolie Louise, ma jolie Louise

Oh joy, love you bring
Oh joy, make my heart sing
And I drove across the desert
I was in my four wheel drive
I was looking for the Buddha
Then I saw Jesus Christ
He smiled and shrugged his shoulders
And he lit a cigarette
Said jump for joy, make some noise
Remember what I said
My soul is a like a ruby
And I threw it in the earth
But now my hands are bleeding
From scrabbling in the dirt
And I look up to the heavens
And a light is on my face
I never never never thought
I'd find a state of grace
Hey joy, love you bring
Oh joy, make my heart sing
Oh joy, joy in everything
Joy joy joy oh joy
Joy joy joy oh joy
I was drowning in the darkness
As I drove down to the sea
Joy joy joy oh joy
And I looked up to the mountain
And the light burst over me
Joy joy joy oh oh joy
You make me sing
Oh joy, the love you bring
Oh joy, you make me sing
Oh joy, in everything
Joy joy joy oh joy
In everything
In everything
Jump for joy
Jump for joy
Jump for joy
Jump for joy
Jump for joy
Jump for joy
You make me sing
The love you bring
In everything

The rangers had a homecoming in harlem late last night
And the magic rat drove his sleek machine over the jersey state line
Barefoot girl sitting on the hood of a dodge
Drinking warm beer in the soft summer rain
The rat pulls into town rolls up his pants
Together they take a stab at romance and disappear down flamingo lane
Well the maximum lawman run down
Flamingo chasing the rat and the barefoot, girl
And the kids round here look just like shadows always quiet, holding hands
From the churches to the jails tonight all is silence in the world
As we take our stand down in jungleland
The midnight gang's assembled and picked a rendezvous for the night
They'll meet `neath that giant exxon sign that brings this fair city light
Man there's an opera out on the turnpike
There's a ballet being fought out in the alley
Until the local cops, cherry tops, rips this holy night
The street's alive as secret debts are paid
Contacts made, they vanished unseen
Kids flash guitars just like switch-blades hustling for the record machine
The hungry and the hunted explode into rock'n'roll bands
That face off against each other out in the street down in jungleland
In the parking lot the visionaries dress in the latest rage
Inside the backstreet girls are dancing to the records that the d.j. Plays
Lonely-hearted lovers struggle in dark corners
Desperate as the night moves on, just a look and a whisper, and they're gone
Beneath the city two hearts beat
Soul engines running through a night so tender in a bedroom locked
In whispers of soft refusal and then surrender in the tunnels uptown
The rat's own dream guns him down
As shots echo down them hallways in the night
No one watches when the ambulance pulls away
Or as the girl shuts out the bedroom light
Outside the street's on fire in a real death waltz
Between flesh and what's fantasy and the poets down here
Don't write nothing at all, they just stand back and let it all be
And in the quick of the night they reach for their moment
And try to make an honest stand but they wind up wounded, not even dead
Tonight in jungleland

There are colors on the street
Oh, red, white, and blue
People shufflin' their feet
People sleepin' in their shoes
[You got endure]
A warnin' sign in the road ahead
There's a lot of people sayin' we'd be better off dead
I don't feel like satan, but I am to them
So I try to forgive 'em any way I can
Keep on rockin' in the free world
Keep on rockin' in the free world
Keep on rockin' in the free world
Keep on rockin' in the free world
There's a girl in the night
With a baby in her hand
Under an old street light
Oh, next to a garbage can
Oh, now she put her kid away, she's gone to get a hit
She hates her life, and what she's done with it
That's one more kid that'll never be cool
Never get to fall in love, never get to be him
Keep on rockin' in the free world
Keep on rockin' in the free world
Keep on rockin' in the free world
Keep on rockin' in the free world
Sadness in the culture, man
You know, you, don't you want to say
Got to feelin' like I'm, like I'm,
Like I'm on my way
Girls, I want you to all say what to feel
Got the manacle, man, of voice and steel
Got the flaxen locks
He got the eyes of clocks
I wish him stay up on the boat until he kill the jocks
I got the super soul
He got the man of steel
He got the higher with the feeling in the meanest feel
Keep on rockin' in the free world
(Stay/keep on)
It would be difficult to work harder than that man
Keepin' us in a free world, that's all I'm gonna say
There's a thousand points of light
For the african man
There's a kinder, gentler,
Coming-to-help-you hand
There's department stores and toilet paper
Styrofoam garbage for the ozone layer
There's a fan of the people, he's standin' on their side
He's got fuel to burn, he's got roads to drive
Keep on rockin' in the free world
Keep on rockin' in the free world
Keep on rockin' in the free world
Keep on rockin' in the free world
A song that needs to understand
I'm here to see pearl jam
They're givin' people 'lieving again
I never say never again
They're makin' me believer again
They rock, rock, rock
Rock, rock, rock, rock
Rock, rock, rock, rock
-N-roll, roll, roll, roll
Roll, roll, roll
Thank you
Thank you, sir
Love ya

[Bono]
While like a giant - proud and happy
I take my baby in my arms
Fragile, innocent and alive
And like a little bird he's
Pushing against my chest
Abandoned quiet and safe
For an instant almost sweetly
My destiny appears to me like a dream
And I see myself, old and surrendered,
Seated there near the coalfire
Waiting for the evening with the anxiety of a child,
Just to see him coming back home
With the gift of his smile
Of his words and kindness
It's like a promise that can solve the enormous joy
Of one of his caresses.
Then I wake up and I've already forgotten
But inside of me the kid's trapped soul advises me
That this new born child is already more important to me
Than that of my own life […]
[Bocelli]
[…] e restai davanti a lui per un po'
e ascoltai nell'aria poi l'afferai
Lui aprì la mano e poi
mi toccò il naso sfiorò la bocca
Io l'abbracciai ed il mondo girò di più
Intorno a noi ogni cosa poi fiorì
E restai davanti a lui per un po'
E fu li che il tempo ci ritrovò
Lui aprì la mano e poi mi toccò il naso
ed io sorrisi
Io l'abbracciai ed il mondo girò di più
Intorno a noi ogni cosa poi fiorì
Il mondo è un puntino di luce blu
Che gira e va con
il soffio degli angeli
Io l'abbracciai ed il mondo girò di più
Che gira e va con
il soffio degli angeli
Io l'abbracciai e restai così, così
[Translation of above Italian]
[...] and I stood in front of him for a while
And listened to the air and then held him
He opened his hand and then
touched my nose and brushed my mouth
I held him and the world turned more
Around us everything blossomed
I stood still for awhile
And it was there that time found us again
He opened his hand then touched my nose
and I smiled
I held him and the world turned more
Around us everything blossomed
The world is a tiny point of blue light
That turns and moves with
the breath of angels
I held him and the world turned more
That turns are moves with
the breath of angels
I held him and stood just so, just so…

When I find myself in times of trouble
Mother mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be
And in my hour of darkness
She is standing right in front of me
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be
And when the broken hearted people
Living in the world agree
There will be an answer, let it be
For though they may be parted there is
Still a chance that they will see
There will be an answer, let it be
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be, yeah
There will be an answer, let it be
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be
And when the night is cloudy
There is still a light that shines on me
Shine on until tomorrow, let it be
I wake up to the sound of music
Mother mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
There will be an answer, let it be
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be

Yes, there was silence
Yes, there was no people here
Yes, I walked through the streets of Dublin
And no-one was near
Yes, I don’t know you
No, I didn’t think I didn’t care
You live so very far away from just across the square
And I can’t reach but I can ring
You can’t touch but you can, you can sing
Across rooftops
Sing down the phone
Sing and promise me you won’t stop
Sing your love, be known
Let your love be known
Yes, there is isolation
You and me, we’re still here
Yes, when we open our eyes we will stare down the fear
And maybe I’ve said the wrong thing
Yes, I made you smile
I guess the longest distance is always the last mile
And I can’t reach but I can ring
You can’t touch but you can, you can sing
Across rooftops
Sing to me down the phone
Sing and promise me you won’t stop
Sing and you’re never alone
Sing as an act of resistance
Sing, though your heart is overthrown
Sing, when you sing there is no distance
So let your love be known
Oh, let your love be known
Though your heart is overthrown
Let your love be known

It's in your voice
I can feel it I can tell
It's in your voice
Has me ringing me like a bell
Peace of mind
Peace comes dropping slow
I'm in the mind to let go of control
Spirit come on down
No I'm not coming down
In the backstreets
In the backstreets of our love
Through the locked doors
Deep down deep down is not enough
Spirit come on down no I'm not coming down
Who can stop us now
It's much too late
Can't slow us down
We can't hesitate
I want a love that's hard
As hard as hate
Levitate
To be the bee
To be the bee and the flower
Before the sweetness
Before the sweetness turns to sour
When freedom comes
Freedom has a scent
It's like the top of a new born baby's head
Baby we can taste it
You and I
Spirit come on down
No I'm not coming down
Who can stop us now
Who could make us wait
Who could slow us down
Make us hesitate
I want a love that's hard
As hard as hate
Levitate
Lift me up
Spirit come on down
No I'm not coming down
Spirit come on down
No I'm not coming down

Heard of a van that is loaded with weapons
Packed up and ready to go
Heard of some gravesites, out by the highway
A place where nobody knows
The sound of gunfire, off in the distance
I’m getting used to it now
Lived in a brownstore, lived in the ghetto
I’ve lived all over this town
This ain’t no party, this ain’t no disco
This ain’t no fooling around
No time for dancing, or lovey dovey
I ain’t got time for that now
Transmit the message, to the receiver
Hope for an answer some day
I got three passports, a couple of visas
You don’t even know my real name
High on a hillside, the trucks are loading
Everything’s ready to roll
I sleep in the daytime, I work in the nightime
I might not ever get home
This ain’t no party, this ain’t no disco
This ain’t no fooling around
This ain’t no mudd club, or c. b. g. b
I ain’t got time for that now
Heard about houston? heard about detroit?
Heard about pittsburgh, p. a.?
You oughta know not to stand by the window
Somebody might see you up there
I got some groceries, some peant butter
To last a couple of days
But I ain’t got no speakers, ain’t got no
Heaphones, ain’t got no records to play
Why stay in college? why go to night school?
Gonna be different this time
Can’t write a letter, can’t send a postcard
I can’t write nothing at all
This ain’t no party, this ain’t no disco
This ain’t no fooling around
I’d like to kiss you, I’d love you hold you
I ain’t got no time for that now
Trouble in transit, got through the roadblock
We blended with the crowd
We got computer, we’re tapping pohne lines
I know that ain’t allowed
We dress like students, we dress like housewives
Or in a suit and a tie
I changed my hairstyle, so many times now
I don’t know what I look like!
You make me shiver, I feel so tender
We make a pretty good team
Don’t get exhausted, I’ll do some driving
You ought to get some sleep
Get you instructions, follow directions
Then you should change your address
Maybe tomorrow, maybe the next day
Whatever you think is best
Burned all my notebooks, what good are
Notebooks? they won’t help me survive
My chest is aching, burns like a furnace
The burning keeps me alive
Try to stay healthy, physical fitness
Don’t want to catch no disease
Try to be careful, don’t take no chances
You better watch what you say

Here she comes like a child with a gun
She makes you feel like you're the only one
She smiles and it's dangerous...in a little black dress
Superman and the filthy rich
Get in the queue to scratch her itch
Sticky fingers pulling at the hem
Of her little black dress
Baby don't mind
She can leave it behind
She don't want anything
Baby's a star, she's gotta keep on shining
She moves like an animal
The women sigh "It's Political"
You could get arrested around here
For that little black dress
Not so simple, it's complicated...
All this being loved and hated
I wanna know what else she's hiding
In that little black dress
Baby don't mind
She can leave it behind
She don't want anything
Baby's a star, she's got to keep on shining
Don't pay me no mind, you're gonna leave me behind
I don't want anything, baby you're a star

Ten years ago on a cold dark night
There was someone was killed 'neath the town hall light
Just a few at the scene, and they all did agree
That the man who ran looked a lot like me
Well the judge said, "Son, what is your alibi?
If you were somewhere else, well you don't have to die"
But I spoke not a word, though it meant my life
I'd been in the arms of my best friend's wife
She walks these hills in a long black veil
She visits my grave when the night winds wail
Nobody knows Lord, nobody sees
Nobody knows but me
Well the scaffold's is high and eternity near
She stands in the crowd and sheds not a tear
But sometimes at night when the cold winds moans
In a long black veil she cries all over my bones
She walks these hills in a long black veil
She visits my grave when the night winds wail
Nobody knows Lord, nobody sees
Nobody knows but me
Nobody knows but me, yeah

I'm a rolling stone all alone and lost
For a life of sin I have paid the cost
When I pass by all the people say
Just another guy on the lost highway
Just a deck of cards and a jug of wine
And a woman's laugh makes a life like mine
The day we met, I went astray
I started down that lost highway
Just like to thank you for being with us tonight
We love you and we know you love us, too
And it's great to know that in Los Angeles it's love, not money, that makes the world go around. Hallelujah
Everybody say amen, amen.
I was just a lad, nearly twenty-two
Neither good nor bad, just a kid like you
But now I'm lost, too late to pray
Lord I take a cost, on the lost highway
Last verse
Boys, don't start to ramblin' round
On this road of sin are you sorrow bound
Take my advice or you'll curse the day
You started down that lost highway
Amen, amen

Judith? judith?)
(can you hear me?)
(can you see me?)
Life on a distant planet
Another atmosphere
Life on a distant planet
So cold inside of here
You can see her
But she can't see you
You can call her name
But she won't even hear you
In the morning of the day
To the evening
D-day and beyond
Lost on a silent planet
Two lone, rising stars
Locked on a silent planet
So close and yet so far
Children scream and shout
Their eyes torn out
Judith turns around and stumbles
To the ground
In the morning of the day
The evening time
D-day and beyond
Oh...girl you fall out
Oh...girl you come out to cry
Have you nothing to say
Girl you come out to cry
Have you nothing to say
In the morning
On to the day time
To the evening

When routine bites hard and ambitions are low
And resentment rides high but emotions won't grow
And we're changing our ways taking different roads
Then love, love will tear us apart again
Love, love will tear us apart again
Why is the bedroom so cold
You've turned away on your side
Is my timing that flawed, our respect run so dry?
Yet there's still this appeal
That we've kept through our lives
Love, love will tear us apart again
Love, love will tear us apart again
Do you cry out in your sleep
All my failings exposed
There's a taste in my mouth
As desperation takes hold
Just that something so good
Just can't function no more
When love, love will tear us apart again
Love, love will tear us apart again

Nothing worth taking so I never really took
Nothing was shaking but baby you really shook
No one was waking until you kept me up
If your heart was breaking you know I won't see you stuck
The pain never felt so good
To feel so bad
I love you
I love you like mad
I love you
I love you like mad
No one worth knowing has ever known a thing
No one who knew how could ever teach the world to sing
You are the only one I've ever listened to
So don't wait for me to ask, tell me what to do
The pain never felt so good

Love
Love you like mad
Don't worry baby if you're in the spotlight
I'll do the maximum time for you tonight
You know that we're not crazy
Well maybe just a touch
Some sweet delight usher the rush
And some gets us close too much
I love you
I love you like mad

Fold my hands and pray for rain

But everybody wants you
To be just like them
They say sing while you slave and I just get bored
I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more

Come closer
You seem so far away
There is something I know you need to say
I feel your emotions
When I look in your eyes
Your silence
Whispering misunderstandings
There's so much you need to realize
You'll feel my emotions if you look in my
EyesHey darlin'
I know you think my love is slipping away
But baby it's all in your mind
Don't worry
Hold on tight and hear me when I say
Baby it's all in your mind
Believe me I believe in you
There's nothing this feeling couldn't do
Move closer

When you refuse me
You confuse me
What makes you think I'll let you in again
Think again my friend
Go on misuse me and abuse me
I'll come out stronger in the end
And does it make you sad
To find yourself alone
And does it make you mad
To find that I have grown
I'll bet it hurts so bad
To see the strength that I have shown
When you answer the door pick up the phone
You wont find me cause I'm not coming home
You do not know how much this hurts me
To say these things that I don't want to say
But have to say them anyway
I would do anything to end your suffering
But you would rather walk away
[x2]
And does it make you sad
To find yourself alone
And does it make you mad
To find that I have grown
I'll bet it hurts so bad
To see the strength that I have shown
When you answer the door pick up the phone
You wont find me cause I'm not coming home

When you answer the door pick up

Weather 'round here choppin' and changin'
Surgery in the air
Print shirts and southern accents
Cigars and big hair.
We got the wheels, petrol's cheap
We only went there for a week
Got the sun, got the sand
Got the batteries and the handicam.
Her eyes all swimming pool blue
Dumb-bells on the diving board
Baby's always attracted to
The things she's afraid of.
Big girl with a sweet tooth watches
Skinny girl in the photo shoot.
Freshmen, squeaky-clean she tastes of chlorine.
Miami, my mammy.
Love the movies, babe
Love to walk through movie sets
Get to shoot someone in the foot
Get to smoke some cigarettes.
No big deal, we know the score
Just back from the video store.
Got the car and the car chase.
What's he got inside that case?
I want a close-up of that face.
Here comes the car chase.
I bought two new suits
Miami
Pink and blue
Miami
I took a picture of you
My mammy
Getting hot in a photo booth
Miami.
I said you looked like a madonna.
You said maybe.
You said I wanna have your baby, baby.
We could make something beautiful
Something that wouldn't be a problem
We could make something beautiful
Something that wouldn't be a problem
Least not in Miami.
You know, some places are like your auntie
But there's no place like Miami
My mammy
Miami
My mammy.

Who is the child sleeping here in my bed
Where are the words to say what's left unsaid
Yeah I've been lying, I've been hiding
Here beside you
I was the saint who disowned you
Now I'm the beggar who owes you
Miserere, misero me
Peró brindo allá vita
Is there a night dark enough for us to hide
There is a light bright enough to make us blind
Yeah I'm a straying man, Lord I got no plan
Drinking from another well
Vivo nell'anima del mondo
Perso nel vivere profondo
Miserere, misero me
Peró brindo allá vita
Another road, another place tomorrow
Running from you, running from love
You give me so much to hold on
Sole magnifico che splendi dentro me
Dammi la gioia di vivere
Oh help me now, help me now
Miserere, miserere

In your arms, I'm afraid to sing

The Mother of God
It's... this is by William Butler Yeats:
The threefold terror of love; a fallen flare
Through the hollow of an ear;
Wings beating about the room;
The terror of all terrors that I bore
The Heavens in my womb.
Had I not found content among the shows
Every common woman knows,
Chimney corner, garden walk,
Or rocky cistern where we tread the clothes
And gather all the talk?
What is this flesh I purchased with my pains,
This fallen star my milk sustains,
This love that makes my heart's blood stop
Or strikes a Sudden chill into my bones
And bids my hair stand up?

I was eight years old and running with a dime in my hand
Into the bus stop to pick up a paper for my old man
I'd sit on his lap in that big old Buick and steer as we drove through town
He'd tousle my hair and say son take a good look around this is your hometown
This is your hometown
This is your hometown
This is your hometown
In `65 tension was running high at my high school
There was a lot of fights between the black and white
There was nothing you could do
Two cars at a light on a Saturday night in the back seat there was a gun
Words were passed in a shotgun blast
Troubled times had come to my hometown
My hometown
My hometown
My hometown
Now Main Street's whitewashed windows and vacant stores
Seems like there ain't nobody wants to come down here no more
They're closing down the textile mill across the railroad tracks
Foreman says these jobs are going boys and they ain't coming back to your hometown
Your hometown
Your hometown
Your hometown
Last night me and Kate we laid in bed
talking about getting out
Packing up our bags maybe heading south
I'm thirty-five we got a boy of our own now
Last night I sat him up behind the wheel and said son take a good look around
This is your hometown

Wow... After I jumped, it ocurred to me.
Life is perfect.
Life is the best, full of magic, beauty,
opportunity, and television.
And surprises... Lot's of surprises, yeah.
And then there's the best stuff, of course.
Better than anything anyone ever made up, 'cause it's real...
You take a stranger by the hand
A man who doesn't understand
His wildest dreams
You walk across the dirty sand
And offer him an ocean
Of what he's never seen
Maybe I was blind
Or I might have closed my eyes
Maybe I was dumb
But what I forgot to say
If you didn't know is…
Never let me go
Never let me go
Never let me go
You run from love
And don't believe
Unless it catches you by the heel
And even then you struggle
From Red Island across the strand
Your footprints still in the sand
Everything else is washed away
I may not be alone
Or I may have found my home
I may have lost my way
But what I forgot to say
If you didn't know
Is never let me go
Never let me go

The tomtoms
When the jungle shadows fall
Like the tick tick tick of the eye of the clock
You're standing up against the wall
Like the drip drip drip of the rain drops
When the sun shines through
So a voice within me
Keeps revealing you
You
Night and day
You are the one
Only you beneath the moon
And under the sun
Whether near to me or far
It's no matter, baby, where you are
I think of you
Night and day
Day and night
Why is it so ?
That this longing for you follows
Wherever I go
In the roaring traffic gloom
In the silence of my lonely room
I think of you
Night and day
Night and day
Under the hide of me
Though such a hungry yearning
Burning inside of me
This torment won't be through
'Til you let me spend my life
Making love to you
Day and night
Night and day
Night and day
Under the hide of me
Oh, such a hungry yearning
Burning, burning inside of me
This torment won't be through
'Til you let me spend my life
Making love to you
Day and night
Night and day
Night and day
Night and day
Night and day
Night, night, night and day
Night, night, night and day
Night and day
Night,
Night and day
All I want to do
Is make love to you
I'll miss you baby sing it

City street lights
And the multiple life
But babe you gotta give and go
Cigarette lights
Then my finger alights
I need to be alone
She can take you tonight
She can make you, that's alright
She can break you tonight
Don't misunderstand
Cigarette girls
Goes head in and whirls
You will be a superman
Open her booths
Deal must to the bruiser
Drinking all I can
We can take that tonight
We can make them, that's right
We can break them tonight
Don't misunderstand
The light...
Alone in the light

You can take it tonight

We rode the streets in the morning light
We held our day in our hands

Don’t talk, just walk
Going nuts, hate my guts
Get good grades, another shove
Stop being a loser
Stop being in love
And why do I need these stupid glasses
I’d give my life to be anyone but me
Yeah
Anyone but me
I wanna be anyone but me
Yeah
This isn’t home, just a house
Broken door, broken glass
Dad’ll yell, tune him out
He’s drunk by now
He has to shout
Keep on walking, just ignore
Just get to your room and shut the door
Let me disappear, or just be
Anywhere but here
Yeah
Anywhere but here
I wanna be
Everyday is like a war and I’m losing it
I’m taking hits from every side
Every side that there is
Everyday I feel the walls are closing in
When can I begin
To get myself right out of this place
Anyone but me
I count the grass as it grows
Anywhere but here
I got to sleep in my clothes
But the shoes don’t fit
I am not what I’ve been told
Where do I, where do I live
I am not what I’ve been sold
What do I take
I’m at the point of possibility
Who will I find
I can almost glimpse infinity
When is the time
I am not where I belong
And I can see an open door
And I can’t live like this, no more
I can’t live like this, no more
I can’t live like this
No more
No no no no no no
No no no more

Forty-five light years
From home
From where you are
Where I wanna be
Beside you
Looking for direction
Star to your affection
The space between you and me
I can't wait any longer
For your love
I can't wait
I can't wait
I can't wait any longer
For it
I can't wait any longer
For your love
The birds still singing for them
As they fly above the firmament
It's not a song of discontent
It's not like that
Up in the sky
Here I am, a space guy
Caught between the love and logic
Out here in the universe
Hey hey
I can't wait any longer
For your love
I can't wait
I can't wait
I can't wait any longer
For it
I can't wait any longer
For your love
And a day as it ends
And you watch as the sun goes down
Pray that the night
Will go quickly now
Your hope
Your prayer
And the clouds leave the sky alone
There's only one light that can guide you
Guide you
I can't wait any longer
I can't wait any longer
For your love
I can't wait any longer
For your love
I can't wait
I can't wait
I can't wait any longer
For your love
For your love
It's like the silence and shock
Of the lights up there shining
You want it
You got it
You want it

Once heard Captain Dan tell me a story
about this lovely girl who's name was Jane
She was vast and deep and filled with glory
Aaaahhhh
Bottom served as home for hull and anchor
She's always fit to quarrel with the wind
The great Titanic yes it's she that sank her
Aaaahhhh
Then she heard me
Say that oath that
made everything clear
I love you
My ocean blue
I like the way your sea sees me
My darling Jane
She speaks to me at times through falling rain
Now twas time to manifest her vigor
Was she fit to quarrel with the wind?
The air was strong but Jane she was much bigger
Aaaaahhhh
Then she heard me
say that oath that
made everything clear

Hasse, hasse, hasse, hasse
White snow turning to slush
A festival of brown in the city of my crush
If you walk around, you can step inside
Köthner straße achtunddreißig
Oh berlin
Who could think they would find you by just looking
Oh berlin
How many of us hide in you
Oh berlin
To think I could know you by your name
To stare and not be stared
To look and not be seen
To feel new feelings
Rather than understand where you've just been
Fame, huh
Oh berlin
Who could they would find you by just looking
Oh berlin
When you flap your angel wings
Oh berlin
To think that I could know you by your name
Chasing the ghosts of our heroes
Lou reed, david bowie, iggy, wim wenders, rilke
To change location rather than change yourself
To ask for directions rather than ask for help
To remain always a true friend
Oh berlin
Who could think they would find you by just looking
Oh berlin
When you flap your angel wings
Oh berlin
To think that I could know you by your name
Who, if I cried out, would hear me among the angelic orders
And even if one to suddenly take me to its heart
I would vanish into its stronger existence
For beauty is nothing but the beginning of terror
That we are still able to bear and we revere it so
Because it calmly disdains to destroy us
Every angel is terror
Every angel is terror
Oh berlin
Every angel is terror
Every angel is terror
Who would think they could find you by just looking
Every angel is terror
Every angel is terror
Oh berlin
How many of us hide in you
Oh berlin
To think that I could know you by a single name

Plus One, Plus two, makes you baby
From old mother hubbard and her big shoe
One too many, one, two not to small
You see the cat in his hat and all
One for the galaxy, One for his voice
You can sing , sing with words in a birdlike song
Math is the sum of magic plus two
Molten lava is hot and chasing us all
Jack be nimble, Jack be quick
Love's so close, your blood is running thick
All you see is written, maybe not correct
Delusion creates illusion and in it we connect
One is for laughter, one is select
You put that king too fast in check
Two is for equal, two is plus tall
Creation measures nobody that falls
You make the difference, you make mistakes
You and the world can all forsake
You are the child born under the stars
Blinding the fear, shines a light of tears
Its all right baby, its all right the milky way
Trust in me shadow, trust in me faith
Ten commandments we all have to face
This is no division, no great divide
Suicide is no place to hide
Crimson is the color of the great red tide
Plus one, Plus two is who made you
You make the changes, two makes me shake
Spiritual Father and mother complete
Trinity is in the child born that we seek.
You one, you two, here is the clue
Lord Jesus is the breakthrough
When Johnny comes marching home again

See a red door
And I want it painted black
No colors anymore
I want them to turn black
I see the girls walk by
Dressed in their summer clothes
I have to turn my head
Until my darkness goes
I see a line of cars
And they're all painted black
With flowers and my love
Both never to come back
I see them turn their heads
Quickly look away
Like a newborn baby
It just happens every day
I look inside my self
See my heart is back
I see my red door
And I want it painted black
Maybe then I'll fade away
And not have to face the facts
It's not easy facing up
When your whole world is black
No more will my green sea
Go turn a deeper blue
I could not foresee
This thing happening to you.
If I look hard enough
Into the setting sun
My love will laugh with me
Before the morning comes
I wanna see it painted
Painted black
Black as night
I wanna see it painted
Painted black
Black as night
I wanna see it painted
Painted black
Black as night
I wanna see it painted
Painted black
Black as night
I wanna see it painted
Painted black
Black as night
I wanna see it painted
Painted black
Black as night

Search on, man
God speed and forgive you
Moonshine night
Mountain village
Insane in the woods
In the deep trees
Under the moon
Beneath the stars
They reel and dance
The young folk
Led to the lake
By a king and queen
Oh, I want to be there
I want us to be there
Beside the lake
Beneath the moon
Cool and swollen
Dripping its hot liquor
Frozen moment by a lake
A knife has been stolen
The death of the snake
I know the impossible sea
When the dogs bark
I am a death bird
Naughty night bird
There’s a belief by the children
Of man which states all will be well
Search on, man
Calm saviour
Veteran of wars, incalculable greed
Search on, man
Calm saviour
God speed and forgive you
Morning star
Fragrant meadow person girl
Waiting for us
Waiting for us
Waiting for us
They’re coming
Don’t you
In the broken dagger
My kind of yearn
Who is this
Hush now
Here, out in the desert somewhere in new mexico, the feds have their own covert, non-existent missile-testing facilities. You know, but it goes on for several hundreds of miles with those scary signs that read: “do not trespass or we shoot.” deploying what they call weather balloons, when in actuality it is hydrogen testing.
Before we end our day, oh lord
We make this prayer to you
Before we end our day, oh lord
We make this prayer to you
These tests happen so far underground the fallout feeds into our water supply.
That you continue in your love
To guard your people here
That you continue in your love
To guard your people here
Be patient. It will be ready for consumption in less than 30 years.
Give us this night untroubled rest
And build our strength in you
Give us this night untroubled rest
And build our strength in you
Your splendour driving far away
All darkness of the fog
Your splendour driving far away
All darkness of the fog
Our hearts desire to love you, lord
Watch over while we sleep
Our hearts desire to love you, lord
Watch over while we sleep
That when the new day dawns on high
We may your praises sing
That when the new day dawns on high
We may your praises sing
Amen, amen, amen, amen

People get ready
There's a train a-coming
You don't need no baggage
You just get on board
All you need is faith
To hear the diesels humming
Don't need no ticket
You just thank the lord
People get ready
For the train to jordan
Picking up passengers
From coast to coast
Faith is the key
Open the doors and board them
There's room for all
Among the loved the most
There aint no room
For the hopeless sinner
Who would hurt all mankind just
To save his own
Have pity on those
Whose chances are thinner
Cause there's no hiding place
From the kingdoms throne
So people get ready
For the train a-coming
You don't need no baggage
You just get on board!
All you need is faith
To hear the diesels humming
Don't need no ticket
You just thank, you just thank the lord

Just a perfect day, drink sangria in the park
And then later when it gets dark
We go home
Just a perfect day
Feed animals in the zoo
Then later a movie too
And then home
Oh it's such a perfect day / (Such a perfect day)
I'm glad I spent it with you
Oh such a perfect day
You just keep me hanging on
You just keep me hanging on
Just a perfect day
Problems are left alone
Weekenders on our own
It's such fun
Just a perfect day
You made me forget myself
I thought I was someone else
Someone good, yeah
Oh it's such a perfect day / (Such a perfect day)
I'm glad I spent it with you
Oh such a perfect day
You just keep me hanging on
You just keep me hanging on
You're gonna reap just what you sow / Reap reap reap, what you sow
You're going to reap just what you sow / Reap reap reap, what you sow
You're going to reap just what you sow / Reap reap reap, what you sow

Inclined to climb up beside you,
Would you tell me that the time just isnt right?
And if I ever find the key you hide so well,
Will you tell me that I can spend the night?
Leavin your smell on my coat, leavin your taste on my shoulder.
I still fail to understand what it is about this woman.
If I could bottle up the chills that you give me
I would keep them in a jar next to my bed.
And If I should ever draw a picture of a woman
It is you that would come flowing from my pen
Leavin your clothes on the floor, Making me walk out the door
And I still fail to understand what it is about this woman.
Helplessly melting as I stand next to the sun.
As she burns me, I am screaming out for more
Drink every drop of liquid heat that I've become.
Pop me open, spoon me out on to the floor.
Leavin your smell on my coat, leavin your taste on my shoulder,
I still fail to understand

So you never knew love
Until you crossed the line of grace.
And you never felt wanted
Till you'd someone slap your face.
So you never felt alive
Until you'd almost wasted away.
You had to win, you couldn't just pass
The smartest ass at the top of the class
Your flying colours, your family tree
And all your lessons in history.
Please, please, please
Get up off your knees.
Please, please, please, please, oh yeah.
And you never knew how low you'd stoop
To make that call
And you never knew what was on the ground
Till they made you crawl.
So you never knew that the heaven
You keep you stole.
Your Catholic blues, your convent shoes,
Your stick-on tattoos now they're making the news
Your holy war, your northern star
Your sermon on the mount from the boot of your car.
Please, please, please
Get up off your knees.
Please, please, please
Leave me out of this, please.
So love is hard
And love is tough
But love is not
What you're thinking of.
September, streets capsizing
Spilling over down the drains
Shard of glass, splinters like rain
But you could only feel your own pain.
October, talk getting nowhere.
November, December; remember
We just started again.
Please, please, please
Get up off your knees, yeah.
Please, please, please, please, ah.
So love is big
Is bigger than us.
But love is not
What you're thinking of.
It's what lovers deal
It's what lovers steal
You know I've found it
Hard to receive
'Cause you, my love
I could never believe.

Spider-man, spider-man
Enhanced genetics
Spider-man
Super-human kinetics
Spider-man
Muscle augmentation
And look at that, web bio-generation
This, this looks like my work
It's getting out
Your life's work, your precious research
Your secrets
Getting sold, getting bought
It isn't possible, is it
It's not, or is it
Maybe it was kassidy
You relied on loyalty
All your staff, where did they go
And what did they take
And what did they know
Our funding dried up
They weren't getting paid
How's it feel to be betrayed
They're leaving like rats from a sinking ship
You're losing control, you're letting it slip
Time to get it
You've been stabbed in the back
Are you gonna roll over, play dead
Or attack
Competition, I don't have any
Wake up son
Someone's cheating you
You do have competition and they're beating you
So fight back, what
Are you just gonna wait
It's an arms race, boy
You can't hesitate
We want new men
A new breed of marines
Not human, we want fighting machines
A new species, one that's harder to kill
And what if I won't
We'll get someone who will
Don't just think of you
Think of God and country
Join the proud and few who know best for their country
Get some patriotic pride or get on to the other side
How do we win, by living in fear
How do we win, get the enemy clear
How do we win, by saying it's done in retaliation
How do we win, by clearing them out
How do we win, by murdering doubt
How do we win, 'cause we're in the right
Get in line or say goodnight
Don't just think of you
Think of God and country
Join the proud and few who know best for their country
Get some patriotic pride or get on to the other side
So deliver
I ain't working for you
We want bigger
That ain't something I do
Pull the trigger
Start being a man
Take care of real business or get off the can
Start making and you'll be in control
Start taking, you wanna suck out my soul
Get funded or your baby won't live
I'm gonna say no
You mean affirmative
Yes sir hut hut
Yes sir hut hut
Yes sir hut hut
Yes sir hut hut
Hut two three
Hut hut hut hut
Hut hut hut two three
Yes sir hut hut hut hut
Yes sir hut hut hut two three
Yes sir hut hut hut hut
Hut hut hut two three

And covered you as the storm of rage came down
But I will not wear you like a purple heart
I will not wear you like a purple heart
To the raging moon burning in the sun
I held on to you, you held on to no one
I followed you 'til you were out of sight
And felt the pain as the bullets took the night
But I will not wear you like a purple heart
I will not wear you like a purple heart
[Repeats, then Bono starts screaming in background

Oh I talk to you, you walk away.
You're still on the down beat
You say you don't want my help.
But you can't escape if you're running from yourself.
I give you my love
I give you my love
Give you my love
Still you walk away.
Well
It's your own late show as you jump to the street below.
But where can you go to leave yourself behind?
Alone in the spotlight of this, your own tragedy.
I give you my love.
Love.
I give you my love.
Give you my love.
I give you my love.
I give you my love.
I give you my love.

Rise Up
In a stairway on a on a stone walk
In a doorstep, golden light
In a cold wind blowing
In the danger, out of the storm
I remain in you
I will recall this storm
This storm recalls you
Rise up, rise up, rise up, rise up
Rise up, rise up, rise up, rise up
Rise up, rise up, rise up, rise up
Rise up, rise up, rise up, rise up
In the lands you have a garden
In the garden it's going dark
In the cold a wind blowing
In the cold wind blowing
I am in this doorway
Feel her in this doorway
Golden hills, golden memories
I follow the ocean wherever it goes
In the doorway I don't know where to start
Emotion in the cold
In the day, darkest night
In the darkest night I know
I stumble in these shoes
In the dark night
Rise up, rise up, rise up, rise up
Rise up, rise up, rise up, rise up
Rise up, rise up, rise up, rise up
Rise up, rise up, rise up, rise up
Rise up, rise up, rise up, rise up
Rise up, rise up, rise up, rise up
Rise up, rise up, rise up, rise up
Rise up, rise up, rise up, rise up
Go in the lonely, lone
Loneliness a path to go
Only if you know
Our love helps me know
Your love will help me
Discover you beneath the thing
Only if you know
Only rise up, rise up

Well it's so hard to listen to these trains
Outside my window here it comes again
And it's calling me begging me
Follow me down the track
And it moans so dark and low
Baby ain't comin' back
Well I refuse to believe
It could happen to me and you
But it's lonesome and it's hard and it's true
I got this whiskey to take care of my lips
I got these long cool steel strings
At my fingertips
I ain't got nothing, I ain't got nothing
To soothe my aching soul
Except this screeching and screaming iron
To tell me where I ought to go
Well I refuse to believe
It could happen to me and you
But it's lonesome and it's hard... and it's true
And I hear the train sigh
And idle down below
Why your love is so sweet and wild
Is something I'll never know
And it sounds like crying
And it sounds like letting go
Oh, breathing and lying
Sinking and dying slow
And I watch from my window
Touching the cold glass sky
And as the train rolls down the track
I say...
Goodbye
Home, home
You wanna take me home?
Home, home
'Cause I wanna go, I wanna
Wanna, wanna, wanna go home
Home, home, ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-home
I wanna go, I wanna love
Take, take, take, take, take me home
Home, no no no no no no no love
Hey, hey
Please...
(Take me home)
Home, home
No no no no no no no love
No no no, no no no, no no no love
(Home)
Ha hah home, home

She would never say where she came from
Yesterday don't matter if it's gone
While the sun is bright
Or in the darkest night
No one knows
She comes and goes
Goodbye, Ruby Tuesday
Who could hang a name on you?
When you change with every new day
Still I'm gonna miss you...
Don't question why she needs to be so free
She'll tell you it's the only way to be
She just can't be chained
To a life where nothing's gained
And nothing's lost
At such a cost
Goodbye, Ruby Tuesday
Who could hang a name on you?
When you change with every new day
Still I'm gonna miss you...
There's no time to lose, I heard her say
Catch your dreams before they slip away
Dying all the time
Lose your dreams
And you will lose your mind.
Ain't life unkind?
Goodbye, Ruby Tuesday
Who could hang a name on you?
When you change with every new day
Still I'm gonna miss you...

Stood on his shadow
They always do
All he wanted to spoil the view
Of people and places
Second-hand faces
He saw but never knew
Look like a painting
A picture of you
Depending on your point of view
She laughed with the others
They call out her name
She smiled, she said
Goodbye
On a Saturday night
On a Saturday night
On a Saturday night
On a Saturday night
Saturday night
Saturday night
They met at a streetlight
Though she never knew
All he wanted was to spoil the view
And just for a second
It felt like a year
He waited for her second tear
On a Saturday night
On a Saturday night
On a Saturday night
On a Saturday night
Saturday night
Saturday night
Can you soar any higher
If you can't let go
To save her in the fire
She won't say no

It takes a seconds to say goodbye,
Say goodbye.
It takes a seconds to say goodbye,
Say goodbay,say bye bye
Where are you going to now?
Lightning flashes across the sky,
From east to wast you do or die.
Like a thief in the night,
You see the world by candlelight.
Fall,rise and...Fall rise and...
In an apartment on Times Square,
You can assemble them anywhere.
Held ro ransom,hell to play,
A revolution every day.
U.S.S.R., D.D.R..
London,New York,Peking.
It's the puppets,It's the puppets who pull the
strings.
Say goodbye,Say goodbye,
Say goodbye,Say goodbye.
It takes a seconds to say goodbye,
Push the button and pull the plug,say goodbye.
Fall,rise and...Fall,rise and...
They're doing the atomic bomb,
Do they know where the dance comes from?
Yes they're doing the atomic bomb,
They wnat you to sing along.
Say goodbye,say goodbye.

Darkness falls and she
Will take me by the hand
Take me to some twilight land
Where all but love is gray
Where I can find my way
Without her as my guide
Night falls, I'm cast beneath her spell
Daylight falls, our heaven turns to hell
Am I left to burn
And burn eternally
She's a mystery to me
She's a mystery girl
She's a mystery girl
She's a mystery girl
She's a mystery girl
In the night of love
Words tangled in her hair
Words soon to disappear
A love so sharp it cut
Like a switchblade to my heart
Words tearing me apart
She tears again my bleeding heart
I want to run, she's pulling me apart
Fallen angel cries
Then I just melt away
She's a mystery girl
She's a mystery girl
She's a mystery girl
She's a mystery girl
She's a mystery girl
Haunted by her side
It's a darkness in her eyes
That so enslaves me
And if my love is blind
Then I don't want to see
She's a mystery to me
Night falls, I'm cast beneath her spell
Daylight comes, our heaven turns to hell
Am I left to burn
And burn eternally
She's a mystery to me
She's a mystery girl
She's a mystery girl
She's a mystery girl
She's a mystery girl
She's...a mystery girl
Mystery girl
She's a mystery girl
She's...a mystery girl
She's a mystery girl
She's a mystery girl

You were always wishing and aching
So ever, always firezone

Soul the silver lining
Seeks your only zone

You hold back but I can see you crawling
We always horse-shoed the nail

Secret fears, visions never to vanish
Crawling shapes now come writhing out
To cast their shadows over this human rout
You set yourself on fire
You set yourself on fire
You set yourself on fire
Breath of our breath with no blood or bone
Never grows weary, never grows old
Mutters and mumbles in infinite ways
Ever the tyrant to the willing slaves
You set yourself on fire
You set yourself on fire
You set yourself on fire
Much of madness and more of sin
No government of this vast, formless thing
You set yourself on fire
You set yourself on fire
You set yourself on fire

Wake
In the morning when you wake up
You won’t have much but you’ll have enough
When you are weakest I’ll be strong enough for you
Dreams, the ones where you are fearless
Can’t break what’s broken, you are tearless
Steal back your innocence
That’s what they stole from you
You’re gonna sleep like a baby tonight
Not everything can be so black and white
There are demons in the broad daylight
But you can sleep like a baby tonight
Stop, stop
Where you stand right now, just stop
Don’t think or look down at the drop
The people staring from the street don’t know what you’ve got
You’re gonna sleep like a baby tonight
No, not everything can be so black and white
There are demons in the broad daylight
But you can sleep like a baby tonight
Hope is where the door is
When home is where the war is
Where nobody can feel no one else’s pain
You’re gonna sleep like a baby tonight
Not everything can be so black and white
There are demons in the broad daylight
You’ve got to sleep like a baby tonight
Sleep like a baby tonight
Take care of your heart until it is light
Where you stand, where you fall is where I kneel
To take your heart back to where you can feel
Like a child, a child

Oh babe, I don't wanna deal it
Oh, make it alright
Gime some, my love
Away, away, away

I just wanna slide away and come alive again
I will see that love again, and find a life again
I just wanna slide away and come alive again
I wanted to let it go

Across the rolling open sea.
Now I kiss and run through air. Leave the past find nowhere,
Floating forests in the air clowns all around you.
Clowns are here to let u know where u let your senses go.
Clowns all around you its a cross i need to bear.
All this black and cruel is fair, this is an emergency
Don't you hide your eyes from me, open them and see me now.

But holding on so beware I have secrets I wont share.

If I ask u not to stay, clowns are here to let u know where u letyour senses go,
Clowns all around you it's a cross I need to bare.

My love is cruel as the night
She steals the sun and shuts out the light.
All of my colours, they turn to blue
Win or lose.
She does his slow dancing, slow dancing,
She does his slow... dancing.
All night long.
Scarlet eyes and see-through heart
She saw me coming right from the start.
She picked me up, but had me down on my knees
Just to begging her, begging her please.
Take me slow dancing, slow dancing,
She took me slow... dancing.
All night long.
And, I don't know why a man
Search for himself in his lover's eyes.
No, I don't know why a man
Sees the truth, but needs the lies.
My love is restless as the wind
She moves like a shadow across my skin
She left with my conscience
I don't want it back.
It just gets in the way.
If you wanna go slow dancing, slow dancing,
She took me slow... dancing.
All night long.
Slow dancing

Don't want to lose my shirt
Don't want to dig the dirt
Don't want you to get hurt
Can't help it, I'm a flirt
Don't want to take your drugs
Don't want to be your slug
Don't want to overdress
Don't want to make a mess
Don't want you to confess
Not under duress
Don't want to be untrue
I want to be with you
Don't want to lose my nerve

Don't want to change the frame

Gravity, it's not pulling me
I won't be a picture with no sound
Decaying, I'm praying
You are my air
But I need the ground to kneel upon
And love can't be us all
I don't want to see you smile
I'm breaking it, taking it
I'm breaking slowly in my mind
I'm seeing it, free in it
I know love is in this soul of mine
It's not in your eyes
I don't want
I don't want to see you smile
It started light-hearted
I won't be easier like you said
I'm going, flowing
I'm leaving on the day
Of the day I will live again
You will live again
I don't want to see you smile
God knows, He knows me
Knows me, lonely
You see, hear me, love
Say it again
You're not blind
The smoke machine
Is yours, not mine
I don't want to see you smile
I will live again
You will live again
I just don't want to see you smile

Sing yourself right off your feet
Sing yourself away from victory and from defeat
Sing yourself with fife and drum
Sing yourself to overcome

Southern man better keep your head
Don't forget what your good book said
Southern change gonna come at last
Now your crosses are burning fast
Southern man
I saw cotton and I saw black
Tall white mansions and little shacks.
Southern man when will you pay them back?
I heard screamin' and bullwhips cracking
How long? How long?
Southern man better keep your head
Don't forget what your good book said
Southern change gonna come at last
Now your crosses are burning fast
Southern man
Lily belle, your hair is golden brown
I've seen your black man comin' round
Swear by God I'm gonna cut him down!
I heard screamin' and bullwhips cracking

Like to, I'd like to try a song that I
Think we've only played once before, so
This is a city that a lot of irish people came to this city,right?
So this time, this irish, these irish people
Came as rock and roll band, okay?
So, but this is a folk song
It's like, the irish kinda' hold america
In a very special place because, for over a hundred years or more
Irish have come over here to find work and find a future
And they brouught with them songs, old irish folk songs
That became old american folk songs
And, I hope maybe we'd leave behind some songs one day.
This is a song written by peggy seeger
It's a song
I wished I'd heard this song on the raidio
During the miners' strike in england a few years ago
This is called springhill mining disaster
In the town of springhill nova scotia
Down in the dark of the cumberland mine
There's blood on the coal, and the miners lie
In roads that never saw sun or sky
Roads
Shut up for a second, will you?
Stop whistling 'cause I'm not in the beatles, okay?
It's U2 here
In the town of springhill
They don't sleep easy
Often the earth will tremble and roll
When the earth is restless
Miners die
Bone and blood is the price of coal
Bone and blood is the price of coal
Listen to the shouts of the black faced miner
Listen to the call of the rescue team
We have no water, light or bread
So we're living on songs and hope instead
Living on songs and hope instead
In the town of springhill nova scotia
Down in the dark of the cumberland mine
There's blood on the coal, and the miners lie
In roads that never saw sun or sky
Roads that never saw sun nor sky
In the town of springhill
Don't sleep easy
Often the earth will tremble and roll
When the earth is restless
Miners die
Bone and blood is the price of coal
Bone and blood is the price of coal
Bone and blood is the price of coal

And the land is dark
And the moon is the only light we'll see
No, I won't be afraid
No, I won't be afraid
Just as long as you stand
Stand by me
So darling, darling,
Stand by me,
Oh, stand by me
Oh, stand,
Stand by me
Stand by me
If the sky that we look upon
Should tumble and fall
Or the mountains should crumble to the sea
I won't cry, I won't cry,
No, I won't shed a tear
Just as long as you stand
Stand by me

I've got no home in this world
Just gravity
Luck and time
I've got no home in this world
Just you and you're not mine
Stateless
Weightless
There are no colours in your eyes
There's no sunshine in your skies
There's no race only the prize
There is no tomorrow only tonight
Stateless, what's the difference?
You can cover the world with your thumb
But it's still so big, so bright, so beautiful
Stateless
Weightless
(scat)
Pushing down on me
Feel your weight
Want to feel your weight
Pushing down on me

Green light, 7-11
You stop in for a pack of cigarettes
You don't smoke, don't even want to
Hey now, check your change
Dressed up like a car crash
Your wheels are turning but you're upside down
You say when he hits you, you don't mind
Because when he hurts you, you feel alive
Hey babe, is that what it is
Red lights, gray morning
You stumble out of a hole in the ground
A vampire or a victim
It depends on who is around
You used to stay in to watch the adverts
You could lip synch to the talk shows
And if you look, you look through me
And when you talk, you talk at me
And when I touch you, you don't feel a thing
If I could stay
Then the night would give you up
Stay...and the day would keep its trust
Stay...and the night would be enough
Faraway, so close
Up with the static and the radio
With satellite television
You can go anywhere
Miami, new orleans
London, belfast and berlin
And if you listen I can't call
And if you jump, you just might fall
And if you shout, I'll only hear you
If I could stay
Then the night would give you up
Stay... Then the day would keep its trust
Stay... With the demons you drowned
Stay... With the spirit I found
Stay... And the night would be enough
Three o'clock in the morning
It's quiet and there's no one around
Just the bang and the clatter
As an angel runs to ground
Just the bang
And the clatter
As an angel
Hits the ground

Wild eyes in the wilderness
Where're you going with the devil in hand?
Wild eyes in the wilderness
Where're you going with the devil in hand?
I'm going to build the bridges high
For working money, for working money
I'm going to climb then the bridges high
Caledonia brother far away
Still water, laying over
Still water, lay my body down
Still water, laying over
Caledonia river far away...
Sad eyes in the weary night
Have you seen your brother
Have you seen your brother
Waiting by the river grand
The Caledonia river oh, so wide
Going to where the rain falls
Look for my brother
Look for my brother
Going to where the rain falls
Caledonia river far away
Still water, laying over
Still water, lay my body down

When the sky falls and the Earth quakes
We gon put this back together
We won't break
Sa Pa Sé, my Port-Au-Princes
my Haitian Gods and all of my Princesses
Our condolences as you fightin' against this
we're right by your side as we tryin' to make sense of this
heavenly father help us see through these problems
and for those that left, accept them into your garden
so here's my theory, the country's already starvin'
so we sacrificed many to shed light on all of them
God please pardon, I speak from the heart
its the only way I see this tragedy befall on them
so lets get involved with them, hand to hand with them
arm to arm with them til they get strong again,
When the sky falls…
Can't wait until tomorrow
Haiti, Mon Amour
Haiti, Mon Amour
Not gonna leave you stranded, alone, alone
oh no
Learn from the past, New Orleans was flooded
So we know we just can't rely on the government
We under the rubble again, here we go rumbling when
When we gon catch a break, my friend lost his mother and then
And then, Carline lost her uncles and them
Buried with no caskets, they just put covers on them
And the tears fall, and we fight back
Story ain't done, it can't end like that
Nah not like this, tomorrow's survivors gonna carry on your name
You live on inside us, your memory's alive with us
You inspired us, to rebuild this country, you just guide us
It's not the angels that are on their way
its not the bells of Santa Trinite
the people waiting, position vacant(?)
for hands to help, not just to pray
Haïti va s'élever
Tu vas te relever
Nous nous éléverons
Ensemble ensemble ensemble
(not gonna leave you stranded…)
we gon put this back together we wont break
we gon put this back together we wont break
we gon put this back together we wont break
we gon put this back together we wont break

Stranger, stranger in a strange land.
He looked at me like I was the one who should run.
We asked him to smile for a photograph
Waited a while to see if we could make him laugh.
The soldier asked for a cigarette
His smiling face I can't forget.
He looked at me across the street
But that's a long way here.
Oh, and I wish you were here.
Oh, and I wish you were here.
Stranger, stranger in a strange land.
He looked at me like I was the one who should run.
I watched as he watched us get back on the bus
I watched the way it was
The way it was when he was with us
And I really don't mind sleeping on the floor
But I couldn't sleep after what I saw
I wrote this letter to tell you the way I feel.
Oh I wish you were here
Oh I wish you were here
To see what I could see
To hear
And I wish you were here.

Every man has two cities he needs to be
The one he can touch
And the one he can’t see
The one where a stranger’s a friend
Every man has got one city of liberty
For me it’s Paris, I love it
Every time I get lost down these ancient streets I find myself again
You’re free, baby, baby
Free now and forever
It’s Christmas time
You can decide to forget or to remember
You’re free, baby, baby
I didn’t come down here to fight ya
I came down these streets of love and pride to surrender
The streets of surrender
I heard a farfetched story
That nobody seems to know
I think it was about that stranger
It was youth, it was love and it was danger
It was winter with that warm it gets before the snow
It chilled my soul
Everybody’s crying about some kid
That they found lying on a beach
Born in a manger
You’re free, baby, baby
Free now and forever
It’s Christmas time
You can decide to forget or to remember
You’re free, baby, baby
I didn’t come down here to fight ya
I came down these streets of love and pride to surrender
The streets of surrender

Strawberries, cherries
And an angel´s kiss in spring
My summer wine is really made
From all these things
I walked in town
On silver spurs that jingled too
And sang a song
That I had sang just for a few
She saw my silver spurs
And said lets pass some time
And I will give to you summer wine
Oh summer wine
Strawberries, cherries
And an angel´s kiss in spring
My summer wine is really made
From all these things
Take off your silver spurs
And help me pass the time
And I will give to you summer wine
Oh summer wine
My eyes grew heavy and my lips
They could not speak
I tried to stand up
But I could not find my feet
She reassured me with an unfamiliar line
And then she gave to me more summer wine
Oh summer wine
Strawberries, cherries
And an angel´s kiss in spring
My summer wine is really made
From all these things
Take off your silver spurs
And help me pass the time
And I will give to you summer wine
Oh summer wine
When we woke up the sun was shining in our eyes
My silver spurs were gone
My head felt twice the size
We took my silver spurs a dollar and a dime
And left us craving for more summer wine
Oh summer wine

The city's alight
With lover and lies
Bright blue eyes.
The city's bright,
Brighter than day tonight,
Surrender, Surrender,
Surrender, Surrender.
Sadie said she couldn't
Work out what it was all about.
And so she let go,
Now Sadie's on the street,
And the people she mees you know.
She tried be to be a good girl
And a good wife.
Raise a good family.
Lead a good life.
It's not good enough
She got herself up on the 48th floor
Got to find out,find out
What she's living for.
Surrender, Surrender,
Surrender, Surrender.
The city's a fire,
A passionate flame
That knows me by name.
The city's desire
To take me for more and more.
It's in the street getting under my feet,
It's in the air it's everywere I look for you,
It's in the things I do and say.
If I want to live, I've got to die to myself
someday.
Papa sing my sing my song,
Papa sing my sing my song,
Papa sing my sing my song.

And I'll coming to say goodbye
Took inside and maids by buck-bye
More than dreams and the bottom come
When she would come back, right and well
And if you catch me I'll take your time
Ride on home in monday's own
Of this coldness in my heart
And this whole world riding home
Sweet baby Jane, sweet baby Jane
Sweet baby Jane, sweet baby Jane
And if you call, I'll come running
And if you ask, I will be given

(ooh hmmyeah)
(oh yeah, oh...)
Didn't we break the silence
Didn't we fear the storm
Didn't we move the earth
Didn't we shoot for the sky
And didn't we catch the fire
And didn't we call upon the spirits
And didn't we fall together
And didn't we die for love
Days on the run
Nights in hiding
Hoping that you were
The healing inside me
Breathe in the sweet fire of love / i'm not afraid anymore
Sweet, sweet fire / i'm not alone
Breathe in the sweet fire of love / i'm not the same anymore
Sweet, sweet fire / the sweet fire of love
The sweet fire of love
Didn't we cross new waters
Didn't we mix new blood
Didn't we build brand new bridges
Didn't we hold back the flood
Broken idols by the side of the road
They didn't fall on the side of the law
Here she comes a-shining like a light
Here she comes salvation in the night
Days on the run
Nights in hiding
Hoping that you were
The healing inside me
Breathe in the sweet fire of love / i'm not afraid anymore
Sweet, sweet fire / i'm not alone
Breathe in the sweet fire of love / i'm not the same anymore
Sweet, sweet fire / sweet fire of love
Fire of love
(sweet fire of love)
Didn't we shine like silver
Didn't we bear the cross
Didn't we bring down the hammer
Didn't we beat on the drum
Didn't we?
Days on the run / here she comes a-shining like a light
Nights in hiding / here she comes salvation in the night
Hoping that you were / i'm giving up the ghost
The healing inside me / i'm giving up the ghost
Breathe in the sweet fire of love / i'm not afraid anymore
Sweet, sweet fire / i'm not alone
Breathe in the sweetest fire of love / i'm not the same anymore
Sweet, sweet fire / sweet fire of love
Sweet fire of love
Fire of love
Love, love
Sweet fire of love
Fire, yes
(hey, hey soul)
(hey, hey, love)
(hey, hey)
(hey, hey love)

My love, she throws me like a rubber ball
(Oh, the sweetest thing.)
But she won't catch me or break my fall.
(Oh, the sweetest thing.)
Baby's got blue skies up ahead
But in this, I'm a raincloud
You know she wants a dry kind of love.
(Oh, the sweetest thing.)
I'm losin' you, I'm losin' you
Ain't love the sweetest thing?
I wanted to run, but she made me crawl
(Oh, the sweetest thing.)
Eternal fire, she turned me to straw.
(Oh, the sweetest thing.)
I know I got black eyes
But they burn so brightly for her
I guess it's a blind kind of love.
(Oh, the sweetest thing.)
I'm losin' you, I'm losin' you
Ain't love the sweetest thing?
Ain't love the sweetest thing?
Blue-eyed boy meets a brown-eyed girl.
(Oh, the sweetest thing.)
You can sew it up, but you still see the tear.
(Oh, the sweetest thing.)
Baby's got blue skies up ahead
But in this, I'm a rain-cloud,
Ours is a stormy kind of love.
(Oh, the sweetest thing.)

(Ooo, Ooo, yeah)
(Come on)
Look over yonder, Apollo at a distance
You can hear his music if you listen to the wind (blow)
I want to be there - I want to be right there
I want to see it with my own eyes
Bear witness, I'm wailing like the wind
Come bear witness, the half-breed rides again
In these hands, I've held the broken dream
In my soul, I'm howling at the moon
Testimony / Whoa-ah
Testimony / Whoa-ah
Declare yourself, I will testify
Testimony / Whoa-ah
Testimony / Whoa-ah
State the truth, I will testify
I had a revelation like runaway horses
Took to the road with a carnival show (roll on)
Those golden days on Smokey Mountain (lord)
Playing guitar in a one man band (that's right)
Bear witness, I'm howling at the moon
Come bear witness, I've danced among the ruins
In these shoes, I've walked a crooked mile
All my life I been searching for the nightbird
Testimony, testimony
Declare yourself - I will testify
Testimony / Ah-ha
Testimony / Whoa-ah
Speak the truth, I will testify
Are you ready to take the heat
Are you ready to blow the steam
Are you ready to bag the street
You got nothing to lose - but your chains
For forty days and forty nights
I come across the desert
Apollo right by my side (rave on)
Bear witness, I'm wailing like the wind
Come bear witness, the half-breed rides again
In these hands, I've held the broken dream
In my soul, I'm howling at the moon
Testimony, testimony (tell them)
Declare yourself - I will testify
Testimony (oh oh), testimony
Speak the truth, I will testify
(This is my)
(Testimony, testimony) / Mmm this is my testimony
(I will testify)
Testimony ah ha
Testimony whoa ha
Speak the truth
I will testify
Testimony, testimony oh-ha
Declare yourself - I will testify
Testimony / (Oh oh)
Testimony
Speak the truth, I will testify

That's life, that's what all the people say
You're ridin' high in April, you're shot down in May
But I know I'm gonna change that tune
When I'm back on top, back on top in June
I say that's life, and as funny as it may seem
Some people get their kicks stompin' on a dream
But I don't let it, get me down
'Cause this old world, just keeps spinnin' around
I've been a puppet, a poet, a pauper, a pirate, a pawn and a king
I've been up and down and over and out and I know one thing
Each time I find myself flat on my face
I pick myself up and get back in the race
That's life, I tell ya, I can't deny it
I thought of quitting baby, but my heart just won't buy it
And if I didn't think it was worth just one more try
I'd roll myself up in a big ball and die
I've been a puppet, a pauper, a pirate, a poet, a pawn and a king
I've been up and down, over and out, I know one thing
Each time I find myself layin' flat on my face
I just pick myself up and I get back in the race
That's life, I can't deny it
I thought of quitting baby, but my heart just won't buy it
But if there's nothin' shakin' come here this July
I'm gonna roll myself up in a big ball and die

Here's to the Ronnie, the voice we adore
Like coals from a coal bucket scraping the floor
Sing out his praises in music and malt
And if you're not Irish, that isn't your fault
Raise up our voices like dogs in a pack
Thankful for honest men we never lack
We got 'in by twenties, we got 'in by ones
Them and their daughters and all of their sons
Here's to you, Ronnie Drew
Here's to you, Ronnie Drew
Ronnie Drew, we love you, yes we do
Here's to you, Ronnie Drew, here's to you
And what's it to any man whether or no'
Whether I'm easy or whether I'm true
As I lifted her petticoat easy and slow
And I tied up me sleeve for to buckle her shoe
Get up and go at it, five until five
When the whistle says budge it we come back alive
He'll sing to the heavens, he's stormy as hell
And wherever he goes, we'll be wishing him well
Here's to you, Ronnie Drew
Here's to you, Ronnie Drew
Ronnie Drew, we love you, yes we do
Here's to you, Ronnie Drew, here's to you
The dawn and the dust, the wise, the unjust
Kids in gambling games
The unheard, the unseen, the unwashed and unclean
Where the streets all have names
Baggers, street masons, street wagons to Stevens
With lovers and loners who can hear all intoners
The goths and the ravers, invalids and traders
Sing out Ronnie Drew
A life for a life or a hand for a hand
Trust in the music and strike up the band
The more that we sing the less that we fight
Time and again this is proved to be right
Build you a statue on St. Stephen's Green
No fairer monument ere to be seen
The statue of Ronnie Drew holding the hand
Of a girl with her hair in a black velvet band
Here's to you, Ronnie Drew
No stranger to devils or angles to tell
Here's to you, Ronnie Drew
A friend of a friend of a friend of a friend of a friend to you
Ronnie Drew, we love you, yes we do
Here's to you, Ronnie Drew, here's to you
Here's to you, Ronnie Drew, here's to you, Ronnie Drew
Here's to you, Ronnie Drew, here's to you, Ronnie Drew
And what's it to any man whether or no'
Whether I'm easy or whether I'm true
As I lifted her petticoat easy and slow
And I rolled up me sleeve for to buckle her shoe

When you look so good
The pain in your face doesn't show
When you look so good
Baby, you don't even know
When the world is ours
And every door smells of fresh paint
When the girl involved
Says its friction that makes you a saint
When we've seen enough
To know it's children that teach
When you're free enough
To wake up on a bed on a beach
You're the best thing about me
The best thing that ever happened to boy
You're the best thing about me
I'm the kinda trouble that you enjoy
You're the best thing about me
The best thing are easy to destroy
You're the best thing about me
Why... why am I walking away
Why am I walking away
I'll be crying out
How bad can a good boy be?
Shooting off my mouth
That's another great thing about me
I got everything, but I feel like nothing at all
There's no risky thing for a man
Who's determined to fall
You're the best thing about me
The best thing that ever happened a boy
You're the best thing about me
I'm the kinda trouble that you enjoy
You're the best thing about me
The best things are easy to destroy
Save me from myself
The best thing
The best thing

I met a man in gray
Yesterday
Told a story, oh
I've a ring of gold
He was told
The dream is over
The dream is over
The dream is over
(Wake up)
Tomorrow, I will seek and find
The peace of mind
He left behind
So, he knows I know
I've a ring of gold

The dream is over
The dream is over
The dream is over / Over

Take me to the house of rain
You know I'm gonna never be
Matches in a simple way
As the structure sits along the way
Hey that`s known as the flowering rose, a flowering rose that said my name
Kings and wine the flowering rose, the flowering rose of Glastonbury
Yeah, oh, rock and roll sunshine
Yeah, oh, a miracle will give you time
Some things you just can`t control
Sometimes you have to let go
Going to a brand new set
Music it will set me right
Nothing for the house of rain
Nothing that has ever been
Hey that`s known as the flowering rose, a flowering rose that said my name
Kings and wine the flowering rose, the flowering rose of Glastonbury
Yeah, oh rock n roll sunshine
Yeah oh a miracle will give you time
Living like a pilgrim sleeping
Under the flower of the American dream
Set the scene like a thought worth keepin
Livin in a dream jeez you can't be sleepin
Yeah, oh, rock n roll sunshine
Yeah, oh, A miracle will give you time
Yeah, oh rock n roll sunshine
Yo oh rock n roll sunshine
A miracle will give you time
A miracle will giv you time
A miracle will let you fly
A miracle

Alive in an ocean
A world that I didn't see
I walk the world backways
It's aways the same ballgame
That's out of mind
Out of the living world
Out of time
I break all the rules
They call me a fool
I cartoon in motion
A hero pretends no pain
A clown slipping backwards
You laugh at another's shame
But I don't mind
I know I'm limping low down
I don't mind
Winners or losers
It's all just a game
And I'm going down
And I'm strolling down
Life and an answer
The key to an open door
Admiting I'm laughing
Living I'm limping more
It's out of mind
Out of the living world
Out of time
Winners or losers
It's always a game
And I'm going down
But I'm strolling down
To rout around
And around, and around
To round round
There's a cloud
There's a cloud
So...the fool has found the golden key
So...it's waiting there for you and me
Just a fool, a street jester
The hero of society
Just a fool, a street jester
Look at me, now can't you see
A life in emotion
A world I'm glad I didn't see
A cartoon in motion
A key to the same day
I don't mind, I'm here to know
I wanna go go go go go
So...the fool has found the golden key
It's so...it's waiting there for you and me
Just a fool, a street jester
The hero of society
Just a fool, a street jester
Look at me, now can't you see

Stomp it down for you
Shake the plastic bag and do the twisty-thingy-doo
The garbage man
Oh, the garbage man can
The garbage man can
And he does it with a smile and never judges you.
Who can take this diaper
Ma'am, I don't mind at all
Who can clean me up before the big policeman's ball
The garbage man
Yes, the garbage man can
The sanitation folks are jolly friendly folks
Courteous and easy-going
They mop up when you're over-flowing
And tell you when you arse is showing
Who can

Cause he's the homer simpson man

Shine like a fading sky
She holds one love, the sky
It's no secret that the stars
Are falling from the sky
It's no secret that I left you
And still I don't know why
You say the sun is sometimes
Eclipsed by a moon
You know I'd come back, baby
If you gave me some room
It's no secret that a friend
Is someone who lets you help
It's no secret that a liar
Won't believe anyone else
They say a secret is something
You tell one other person
What do you think
Child...
Love...shine like a fading sky
She holds one love, the sky
A man will beg
A man will crawl
But it's never too late
To take his call
It's no secret at all
It's no secret that a conscience can sometimes be a pest
It's no secret ambition bites the nails of success
Every artist is a cannibal, every poet is a thief
And everyone needs music 'cause everyone needs relief
Love...live like a shining star
She calls, the sun will burn
A man will rise
A man will fall
From the sheer face of love
Like a fly from a wall
It's no secret at all
Love...you shine like a burning star
You're falling from the sky
Tonight...
Love...you shine like a burning star
You're falling from the sky
A man will rise
A man will fall
Tonight...
From the sheer face of love
Like a fly from a wall
It's no secret at all
It's no secret that the stars are falling from the sky
The universe expolded 'cause one man told a lie
Look, I gotta go, yeah I'm running outta change
There's a lot of things, if I could I'd rearrange
Love...shine like a fading sky
She holds one love, the sky

Judith?
Judith?
Can you hear me?
Can you see me?
Life on a distant planet
Another atmosphere
Life on a distant planet
So cool inside of here
You can see her but she can't see you
You can call her name but she won't even hear you
In the morning
All through the day
To the evening
D-Day and beyond
Lost on a silent planet
To look rising stars
Lost on a silent planet
So close and yet so far
Children scream and shout their eyes call out
Judith turns around and stumbles to the ground
In the morning
All through the day
To the evening time
D-Day and beyond
Oh girl, you call out
Oh girl you come out to cry
Have you nothing to say
Can you come out to play
Have you nothing to say
Well...
In the morning
All through the daytime
To the evening
D-Day and beyond

On a rattlesnake speedway in the Utah desert
I pick up my money and head back into town
Driving cross the Waynesboro county line
I got the radio on and I'm just killing time
Working all day in my daddy's garage
Driving all night chasing some mirage
Pretty soon little girl I'm gonna take charge
The dogs on Main Street holw 'cause they understand
If I could take one moment into my hands
Mister I ain't a boy no I'm a man
And I believe in a promised land
I've done my best to live the right way
I get up every morning and go to work each day
But your eyes go blind and your blood runs cold
Sometimes I feel so weak I just want to explode
Explode and tear this town apart
Take a knife and cut this pain from my heart
Find somebody itching for something to start
The dogs on Main Street holw 'cause they understand
If I could take one moment into my hands
Mister I ain't a boy no I'm a man
And I believe in a promised land
There's a dark cloud rising from the desert floor
I packed my bags and I'm heading straight into the storm
Gonna be a twister to blow everything down
That ain't got the faith to stand its ground
Blow away the dreams that tear you apart
Blow away the dreams that break your heart
Blow away the lies that leave you nothing but lost and brokenhearted
The dogs on Main Street holw 'cause they understand
If I could take one moment into my hands
Mister I ain't a boy no I'm a man
And I believe in a promised land

Wa, war she's the refugee
I see your face, I see you staring back at me
Wa, war she is the refugee
Her mama say one day she's gonna live in America
In the morning she is waiting
Waiting for the ship to sail, sail away
Wa, war her papa go to war
He gonna fight but he don't know what for
Wa, war her papa go to war
Her mama say one day he's gonna come back from far away
Oh, help me
How can you help me?
In the evening
She is waiting
Waiting for her man to come
And take her by her hand
And take her to this promised land
Wa, war she's a pretty face
But at the wrong time in the wrong place
Wa, war she's a pretty face
Her mama say one days she's gonna live in America
Yeah, America
Wa, war she is a refugee
She coming back, she come and keep you company
Wa, war she is a refugee
Her mama say one day she's gonna live in America

All the promises we made from the
Cradle to the grave
You say you'll give me a highway with no one on it
Treasure just to look upon it
All the riches in the night
You say you'll give me eyes on a moon of blindness
A rive in a time of dryness
A harbour in the tempest
All the promises we make
From the cradle to the grave
When all I want is you
You say you want your love to work out right
To last with me through the night
You say you want a diamond on a ring of gold
Your story to remain untold
You love not to grow cold
All the promises we break from the
Cradle to the grave
When all I want is you
All I want is you

Then it's truely gonna weep
I`m confessing my memories of you in my head
Tell me you want me
I fall a sleep and dream
of alternate realities
And I push myself and ease my pain
Tell me she still loves me
And I can't stop thinking about you
And I can't stop thinking about you
Remember what do I do
And I can't stop thinking about you
Ohh…yeah
Can't believe, can't believe that she would
just hide in the end, be a rebel
I was dressing with you in my dreams
And wake up making love to a pillow
I fall asleep and dream
of alternate realities
And I push myself and ease my pain
Tell me she still loves me
And I can't stop thinking about you
And I can't stop thinking about you
Remember what do I do
And I can't stop, I can't stop
What, what can I do, I do?
Look in my direction
And I'd give my life or soul
To attract your attention
And I tucked my soul
Inside this, miles below
Can I show you
My attempt to
Move my mind

I'm so cool, too bad I'm a loser
I'm so smart, too bad I can't get anything figured out
I'm so brave, too bad I'm a baby
I'm so fly, that's probably why it
Feels just like I'm falling for the first time
I'm so green, it's really amazing
I'm so clean, too bad I can't get all the dirt off of me.
I'm so sane, it's driving me crazy
It's so strange, I can't believe it
Feels just like I'm falling for the first time
Anyone perfect must be lying, anything easy has its cost
Anyone plain can be lovely, anyone loved can be lost
What if I lost my direction? What if I lost sense of time?
What if I nursed this infection? Maybe the worst is behind
It feels just like I'm falling for the first time
It feels just like I'm falling for the first time
I'm so chill, no wonder it's freezing
I'm so still, I just can't keep my fingers out of anything
I'm so thrilled to finally be failing
I'm so done, turn me over cause it
Feels just like I'm falling for the first time
Anything plain can be lovely, anything loved can be lost
Maybe I lost my direction, what if our love is the cost?
Anyone perfect must be lying, anything easy has its cost
Anyone plain can be lovely, anyone loved can be lost
What if I lost my direction? What if I lost sense of time?
What if I nursed this infection? Maybe the worst is behind!

Let's read the trees and their Autumn leaves
As they fall like a dress undone
At the end of summers love will find lovers
Who need the shadows of a winter sun
Don't tell me you're leaving we can hide in the evening
It's getting darker than it should
If we read the leaves as they blow in the breeze
Would it stop us now, my love
Time enough for hard questions
Time enough for all our fears
Time is tougher than we both know yet
Time enough for tears
The moon is milk and the sky where it's split
Is magic, and we all need to believe we can
Wake in the dreams, it's not as hard as it seems
You know its harder to leave
Time enough for being braver
Time enough for all the fears
Time is tougher than we both know yet
Time enough for tears
I heard you say underneath your breath
Some kind of prayer
I heard you say underneath your breath that
You never want to feel this way about anybody else
Time enough for hard questions
Time enough for all our fears
Time is tougher than we both know yet
Time enough for tears
Time enough for being braver
Time enough I love this time of year
Time is tough, its running away from us
Time enough for tears
Time enough for tears
(My heart, I can... it's okay, it's okay...)

Won't you come back tomorrow
Won't you come back tomorrow
Won't you come back tomorrow
Can I sleep tonight?
Outside, somebody's outside
Somebody's knocking at the door
There's a black car parked at the side of the road
Don't go to the door
Don't go to the door
I'm going out
I'm going outside mother
I'm going out there
Won't you be back tomorrow
Won't you be back tomorrow
Will you be back tomorrow?

Who broke the window
Who broke down the door?
Who tore the curtain
And who was it for?
Who heals the wounds
Who heals the scars?
Open the door, open the door
Won't you come back tomorrow?
Won't you be back tomorrow?

Can I sleep tonight?
'Cause I want you

Open up, open up, to the Lamb Of God
To the love of He
Who made the blind to see
He's coming back
He's coming back
Oh, believe Him
I'm going to be back, mother
I'm going to be back, mother

Heyo, I lost something
My mind is telling me I can't go wrong
I lost it, a single mission
I want to worry, but it's never the one
Wish you'd come and work it right
And make the rounds with me
You can tell me time and when I'm going south
Everyone is with me
Busy to live my life
I've gotta live my life tonight
Schooldays, I really run to
I gotta move it, gotta move in my mind
Loving, a single mission
No one told me where to live in my head
I get things mixed up and nothing's right
And some days I go working
One thing I consider to be right is to
Just go around and choose it
I've gotta live my life tonight
I've gotta live my life tonight
You...

Well my friends are gone and my hair is grey
I ache in the places where I used to play
And I'm crazy for love but I'm not coming on
I'm just paying my rent every day
In the Tower of Song
I said to Hank Williams: how lonely does it get?
Hank Williams hasn't answered yet
But I hear him coughing all night long
Oh a hundred floors above me
In the Tower of Song
I was born like this, I had no choice
I was born with the gift of a golden voice
And twenty-seven angels from the Great Beyond
Well they tied me to this table right here
In the Tower of Song
So you can stick your little pins in that voodoo doll
I'm very sorry, baby, doesn't look like me at all
I'm standing by the window where the light is strong
Ah they don't let a woman kill you
Not in the Tower of Song
Well you can say that I've grown bitter but of this you may be sure
The rich have got their channels in the bedrooms of the poor
And there's a mighty judgement coming, but I may be wrong
You see, you hear these funny voices
In the Tower of Song
I see you standing on the other side
I don't know how the river got so wide
I loved you baby, way back then
And all the bridges are burning that we might have crossed
But I feel so close to everything we've lost
We'll never, we'll never have to lose it again
So I bid you farewell, I don't know when I'll be back
There moving us tomorrow to that tower down the track
But you'll be hearing from me baby, long after I'm gone
I'll be speaking to you sweetly
From a window in the Tower of Song
Well my friends are gone and my hair is grey
I ache in the places where I used to play
And I'm crazy for love but I'm not coming on
I'm just paying my rent every day
Oh in the Tower of Song

I like to smile but I'd most like the smile to stay with you
I like good times but I can't feel them without you
By my side, the heart is the place we have to find
Jump up beside me, jump up beside me
If I should die
I couldn't tell the world how I felt about you
And I'd like more time
To describe the feeling when
I feel you in my arms
Take you in my hand
How could I let you go?
Somebody save me
Somebody save me from myself
'Cause you sing, you sing my favourite song
'Cause you sing, my favourite song
I like good times
But the better they are the better chance they will go wrong
You sing my favourite song
You sing my favourite song
If I could swim, I'd swim in circles.
And never drown
If I did, I'd drown with you
If I had enough of my life
It would be because
I hadn't enough of you
Then I would die
Die, die, die, die

Two shots of happy, one shot of sad.
You think I'm no good, well I know I've been bad.
Took you to a place, now you can't get back.
Two shots of happy, one shot of sad.
Walked together down a dead-end street
We were mixing the bitter with the sweet.
Don't try to figure out what we might have had.
Just two shots of happy, one shot of sad.
I'm just a singer, some say a sinner
Rolling the dice, not always a winner.
You say I've been lucky, well hell, I made my own
Not part of the crowd not feeling alone.
Under pressure but not bent out of shape
Surrounded, we always found an escape.
Drove me to drink but hey, that's not all bad.
Two shots of happy, one shot of sad.
Guess I've been greedy all of my life
Greedy with my children, my lovers and my wife.
Greedy for the good things as well as the bad.
Two shots of happy, one shot of sad.
Maybe it's just talk, saloon singing
The chairs are all stacked, the swingers stopped swinging.
You say I hurt you, you put the finger on yourself
Then, after you did it, you came crying for my help.
Two shots of happy, one shot of sad.
I'm not complaining baby, I'm glad.
You call it compromise, well what's that?
Two shots of happy, one shot of sad.
Two shots of happy, one shot of sad.

She said it wasn't cold
She left her coat at home that day.
She wore canvas shoes, white canvas shoes.
Around her neck she wore a silver necklace.
"It was given to me by my father." she said.
"That was given to me."
She took the back way home
Passed the lights at Summer Hill
Turned left onto the North Strand and on
On towards the sea.
He said he was an artist
But he really painted billboards
In large capital letters.
In large capital letters.
He was telling jokes
Nobody else would listen to him.
I saw you that day, your lips of cherry red
Your legs were crossed, your arms wide open
Your hair was coloured gold
And like a field of corn
You were blown by the wind
You were blown by the wind.
Walk, walk, walk
To the water.
Walk with me awhile.
Walk, walk, walk
To the water.
Walk with me
In the light.
A room in the Royal Hotel
With sea-facing views.
A man with a suitcase
Full of things he doesn't need.
I'm looking through your window
I'm walking through your doorway.
I'm on the outside let me in.
Let me love you
Let me love you
Let me.
Walk, walk, walk
To the water.
Walk with me, yeah.
Walk, walk, walk
To the roadside
Walk with me awhile.

Heat haze rising
On hell's own hill
You wake up this morning
It took an act of will
You walk through the night
To get here today
To bring your children
To give them away
Oh... oh this cruel sun
Is daylight never done
Cruelty just begun
To make a shadow of everyone
And if the rain came
And if the rain came
Souls bent over without a breeze
Blankets on burning trees
I am sick without disease
Nobility on it's knees
And if the rain came
And if the rain came... now
Would it wash us all away
On a wave of sorrow
Wave
On a wave of sorrow
Where now the holy cities?
Where the ancient holy scrolls?
Where now Emperor Menelek?
And the Queen of Sheba's gold
You're my bride, you wear her crown
And on your finger precious stones
As every good thing now been sold
Son, of shepherd boy, now king
What wisdom can you bring?
What lyric would you sing?
Where is the music of the Seraphim?
And if the rain came
And if the rain came... now
Would it wash us all away
On a wave of sorrow
Wave
A wave of sorrow
Wave.
Blessed are the meek who scratch in the dirt
For they shall inherit what's left of the earth
Blessed are the kings who've left their thrones
They are buried in this valley of dry bones
Blessed all of you with an empty heart
For you got nothing from which you cannot part
Blessed is the ego
It's all we got this hour
Blessed is the voice that speaks truth to power
Blessed is the sex worker who sold her body tonight
She used what she got
To save her children's life
Blessed are you, the deaf cannot hear a scream
Blessed are the stupid who can dream
Blessed are the tin canned cardboard slums
Blessed is the spirit that overcomes

Never saw someone like you before
Never saw someone that showed me the door
And I love you, I love you

La, la, la-la-la lie
La la la lie
Everybody:
La, la, la-la-la lie
La la la lie
La, la, la-la-la lie
La la la lie
What's happened to you
You used to be so shy
You used to hang your head down
You wouldn't look in my eyes
Did you see some great vision
Did you finally break through
Did you shake the foundations
What's happened to you
La, la, la-la-la lie
La la la lie
La, la, la-la-la lie
La la la lie
What's happened to you
You used to look so tired
Now there's a spring in your step
And your words are on fire
Did you hear some great secret
Did the words ring of truth
Did you rise from the ashes
What's happened to you
Where the four winds meet
The world is so still
The waves are not pounding
And the hungry are filled
Our shadows have crossed here
Where the sun touched the ground
The gathered are singing (ooh)
What a beautiful sound
They're singing
La, la, la-la-la lie
La la la lie
La, la, la-la-la lie
La la la lie
Everybody sing:
La, la, la-la-la lie
La la la lie
La, la, la-la-la lie
La la la lie
What's happened to you
You used to be so unkind
You used to curse at this poor world
So what changed your mind
What stirred such compassion
Is a mystery to me
I don't know what happened
Oh, but I like what I see
Where the four winds meet
The world is so still
The waves are not pounding
And the hungry are filled
Our shadows have crossed here
Where the sun touched the ground
The gathered are singing (ooh)
What a beautiful sound
They're singing
La, la, la-la-la lie
La la la lie
La, la, la-la-la lie
La la la lie
(Go guitar)
La, la, la-la-la lie
La la la lie
La, la, la-la-la lie

Come on, got it
La, la, la-la-la lie

Dancin' where the stars go blue
Dancin' where the evening fell
Dancin' in your wooden shoes
In a wedding gown
Dancin' out on the 7th street
Dancin' through the underground
Dancin' little marionette
Are you happy now?
Where do you go when you're lonely
Where do you go when you're blue
Where do you go when you're lonely
I'll follow you
When the stars go blue
Laughing with your pretty mouth
Laughing with your broken eyes
Laughing with your lover's tongue
In a lullaby
When do you go when you're lonely
when do you go when you're blue
when do you go when you're lonely
I'll follow you
When the stars go blue
when the stars go blue,stars go blue.

Did you get it, did you need it
Was it really what you wanted.
Was it good in the sun
Did you really have some fun?
Did you smash it, did you grab it
Did you jump it like a rabbit.
Did you walk, did you run
Did you slap it, did you come?
And I know that you do
Put your soul into the song.
Where did it all go wrong.
Where did it all go wrong.
Did you crack it, did you taunt it
Was it really what you wanted
Did you burn in the sun
or are you burning for someone?
Did you shoot it, did you stab it
Did you chase it like a rabbit
Did you walk, did you run
Did you come in at number one?
I know what you do
Put your soul in the song
But now it's sinking like you
Where did it all go wrong.
Did you drown it, did you clown it
Would you really have gone down on it
Did you clean it, clean it up
Did you rub it, did you soap.
Did you screen it, did you ream it
Did you ruin it, did you feed it
Is it warm in the sun
With your ear in her tongue.

In a field by a river my love and I did lie
On my naked shoulder she too proud to cry
She said that I must leave her, an icy tear she froze
How could I melt the heart, of a Wild Irish Rose
Well, a gypsy she has made of me, a servant of the streets
From bed to bed I've travelled to taste a love as sweet
Well the heart it knows no reasons, and reason never knows
As I lie with them I am thinking of a Wild Irish Rose
We all fall, ran down, slow down [skip] -and all's love was stale
But with all that I found on C street, I thought I'd found my grave
All night and day she is, and I dance under the glows
And all that time of dancing from a Wild Irish Rose
Well I saw the city of angels it brought a devil out of me
In Hell's hotel on Sunset, showed a whore no mercy
As the orange sky was screaming, from the roof I let her go
These are the dizzy heights that brought me my Wild Irish Rose
Now, wild is the rose that she laid on my grave
A life was all she wanted and a life I surely gave
Like a hundred men before me they lay lying here in rows
Young men, bloody, as a Wild Irish Rose

The yellow sun
Well, it took the hand
Of a country boy
To a city in a far-off land
We made no mark
No shadow at all
On the ancient, holy streets
Where I learned to crawl
The broken and the bruised
The young and the used
The sure and confused
All here
Words will then land on me
Then abandon me
Mangle, untangle me
Leave me on the floor
Rhymes, they sprang in me
Summer sang in me
But summer sings in me no more
Now I'm twenty-five
And trying to stay alive
In a corner of the world
With no clear enemies to fight
It's hot as hell
We're like butter on toast
But there's no army in this world
That can fight a ghost
The broken and the bruised
The young and the used
The sure and confused
All here
Words will then land on me
Then abandon me
Leave me stranded
In guard of the door
Rhymes began in me
Summer sang in me
But summer sings in me no more
Listening to the cries
The strangers
The silence of the foreign grave
Listening to the thunder
The sky is strange
Stretched over everyone
Listening to the tales
The child sings
That goes for days and days
Listening to the calls
Shouts, frustration
At twenty-one
I was born a son
And on that day I knew
I could kill
To protect the ones
We put bullets in guns
Or anything it takes
To take a life until it's still

My cell is ringing, no ID
I want to know who's calling
My garden's overgrown
I go out on my belly crawling / (he's crawling)
I got CCTV, pornography, CNBC
I got the nightly news
To get to know the enemy
All I want is a picture of you
All I want is to get right next to you
All I want is a picture in a locket
Your face in my pocket
I take a pill to stop it
Take me, save me from myself
I know that you've been good to me
Now I need you not to be
Wake me, I feel like I've been asleep
I'm buying things I can't afford
I'm on a high diving board
Oh it's you that's keeping me dry
Xanax and wine
I'm going nowhere
Where I am it is a lot of fun
They're in the desert to dismantle an atomic bomb
I watch 'em shadow box
Check the stocks, I'm in detox
Want the lot of what you've got
If what you've got can make this stop
All I want is a picture of you
All I want is to get right next to you
All I want is your picture in a locket
Your face in my pocket
I take a pill to stop it
Take me, save me from myself
I know that you've been good to me
Now I need you not to be
Wake me, I feel like I've been asleep
Try not to look so bored
You're buying things you can't afford
I got yours and I know you want mine
Xanax and wine
Don't you worry 'bout your mind
Thing is I worry all the time
Don't you worry you'll be fine
You should worry about the day
That the pain it goes away
You know I miss mine sometimes
There is no fiction
That will truly fit the situation
I'm documenting every detail
Every conversation
I'm not used to talking to somebody in their body
It's somebody in a body, it's somebody in a body
In a body there's somebody
Somebody in a body
Somebody, somebody, somebody
It's somebody... in a body
Somebody... in a body
It's somebody... in a body
There's somebody...

I hope you're happy now
I could never make you so
You were a hard man
No harder in this world
You made me cold
And you made me hard
And you made me the thief
Of your heart
Winter is cold
Oh, but you're colder still
And for the first time
I feel like you're mine
I'll share you with the one
Who will mend what falls apart
And turn a blind eye
To the thief of your heart
Oh, you lost
Oh, you lost
Hope
You lost hope
You lost hope
I'll never wash these clothes
I want to keep the stain
Your blood to me is precious
Nor would I spill it in vain
Your spirit sings
Though your lips never part
Singing only to me
The thief of your heart
Oh, you lost
Oh, you lost
Oh, you lost
Hope

Oh, you lost
Oh, you lost

Help, I need somebody,
Help, not just anybody,
Help, you know I need someone, help!
When I was younger, so much younger than today
I never needed anybody's help in any way.
But now these days are gone, I'm not so self assured,
Now I find I've changed my mind and opened up the doors.
Help me if you can, I'm feeling down
And I do appreciate you being round.
Help me, get my feet back on the ground,
Won't you please, please help me.
And now my life has changed in oh so many ways,
My independence seems to vanish in the haze.
But every now and then I feel so insecure,
I know that I just need you like I've never done before.
Help me if you can, I'm feeling down
And I do appreciate you being round.
Help me, get my feet back on the ground,
Won't you please, please help me.

They're piling in the backseat
They're generation steam heat
Pulsating to the back seat
Blitzkrieg bop
Hey ho lets go
Shoot em' in the back now
What they want, I don't know
They're all reved up and ready to go
Hey ho, lets go!
Hey ho, lets go!
Hey ho, lets go!
Hey ho, lets go!

Somebody call me on the phone
Say hey hey hey it's Andy home
You wanna take a walk, you wanna go cop
You wanna go take some Chinese Rock
I'm living on a chinese rock
All my best things are in hock
I'm living on a chinese rock
Everything is in the pawn shop
The plaster's fallin' off the wall
My girlfriend's cryin' in the shower stall
It's hot as a bitch, I should've been rich
But I'm just diggin' a Chinese Ditch
I'm living on a chinese rock
All my best things are in hock
I'm living on a chinese rock
Everything is in the pawn shop

When I'm lyin' in my bed at night
I don't wanna grow up
Nothing ever seems to turn out right
I don't wanna grow up
How do you move in a world of fog that's
always changing things
Makes wish that I could be a dog
When I see the price that you pay
I don't wanna grow up
I don't ever want to be that way
I don't wanna grow up
Seems that folks turn into things
that they never want
The only thing to live for is today...
I'm gonna put a hole in my T.V. set
I don't wanna grow up
Open up the medicine chest
I don't wanna grow up
I don't wanna have to shout it out
I don't want my hair to fall out
I don't wanna be filled with doubt
I don't wanna be a good boy scout
I don't wanna have to learn to count
I don't wanna have the biggest amount
I don't wanna grow up
Well when I see my parents fight
I don't wanna grow up
They all go out and drinkin all night
I don't wanna grow up
I'd rather stay here in my room
Nothin' out there but sad and gloom
I don't wanna live in a big old tomb on grand street
When I see the 5 oclock news
I don't wanna grow up
Comb their hair and shine their shoes
I don't wanna grow up
Stay around in my old hometown
I don't wanna put no money down
I don't wanna get a big old loan
Work them fingers to the bone
I don't wanna float on a broom
Fall in love, get married then boom
How the hell did it get here so soon
I don't wanna grow up

She eats Thorazine in her farina

I am not afraid of life
Of the poor man's struggle
Of the killer's knife
I am not afraid of life
Of an insane rage
Of the minimum wage
I am not afraid of life
I am not afraid of life
I am not afraid of life
But I see an old lady with a shopping bag
And I wonder is life a drag
I am not afraid of pain
But it hurts so bad
I feel so mad
No one see the truth
There's nothing to gain
A life goes down the drain
Don't want to die at an early age
I am not afraid of life
I am not afraid of life
But I see a street crazy shivering with cold
Is it a crime to be old
There's the threat of the nuclear bomb
We know it's wrong
We know it's wrong
Is there a chance for peace
Will the fighting ever cease
Mankind's almost out of luck
A maniac could blow us up
I am not afraid of life
I am not afraid of life
But I get down on my knees and I pray
Is there hope for the world today

Wasn't looking for love, looking for love
I wasn't looking for love, looking for love
I wasn't looking for love, but it was happening.
I turned around the corner and I bumped into her
I was cool and drowning under pressure
My telephone talks and my eyes look a mess
She can trust my time but she took my hand.
I mind my girl kids all
I got a beer and a garden, gotta do it right
Trying everything to abandon ship
I was ready to move, but I didn't have a clue
I wasn't looking for love, looking for love
I wasn't looking for love, but it was happening
I wasn't looking for love, looking for love
I wasn't looking for love, but I was struck by lightning.
Now I pulled my hand, kind of blistering smile
I slapped my arm around her and we danced for a while
Trying to stay cool just as hard as I can
I got while she took my hand.
I was just out watching, what should I think?
I was just go watching when I saw that chick
I was just go watching, what should I think?
I was just go watching until something blinked
I wasn't looking for love, looking for love
I wasn't looking for love, looking for love
I wasn't looking for love, but it was happening.
I wasn't looking for love, looking for love
I wasn't looking for love, looking for love
I wasn't looking for love, but I was struck by lightning

Everything I try to say
Turn to dust and blows away
It's stupid, but I'll say it anyway
While I swim against the tide
Misery my gloating bride
Sickening sweet comfort tell me
At least I tried
Buried is that book of rhymes
Deep within' my mind
Can't cut the cord
I live between the lines
And I never compromise
So I bleed it though my eyes
Think they're taking me home
What a sick surprise
And she watches from the sky
As I fade away and die
Unkept promises still brimming at her lips
I'll bet she smiles to herself
Keeps her secrets on a shelf
She's relieved at keeping time
With no one else

I saw her face
It was a face I love
And I knew I had to run away
And get down on my knees and pray

Still it begins
Needles and pins
Because of all my pride
The tears I gotta hide
Oh I thought I was smart
I stole her heart
Didn't think I'd do but now I see
She's worth to him than me
Let her go ahead
Take his love instead
And one day she will see just how to say please
And get down on her knees
Oh that's how it begins
She'll feel those needles and pins
Hurtin' her, hurtin' her
Why can't I stop and tell myself I'm wrong, I'm wrong, so wrong
Why can't I stand up and tell myself I'm strong
Because I saw her today
I saw her face it was a face I love

Well I don't care about history
Rock, rock, rock 'n' roll high school
'Cause that's not where I wanna be
Rock, rock, rock 'n' roll high school
I just wanna have some kicks
I just wanna get some chicks
Rock, rock, rock, rock, rock 'n' roll high school
Well the girls out there knock me out, you know
Rock, rock, rock 'n' roll high school
Cruisin' around in my GTO
Rock, rock, rock 'n' roll high school
I hate the teachers and the principal
Don't wanna be taught to be no fool
Rock, rock, rock, rock, rock 'n' roll high school
Rock, rock, rock, rock, rock 'n' roll high school
Fun, fun, rock 'n' roll high school

Rock N'
Rock N' Roll Radio
Let's go (
Do you remember Hullabaloo,
Upbeat, Shindig and Ed Sullivan too?
Do you remember rock 'n' roll radio?
Do you remember rock 'n' roll radio?
Do you remember Murray the K,
Alan Freed, and high energy?
It's the end of the 70's
It's the end of the century
Do you remember lying in bed
With your covers pulled up over your head?
Radio playin' so no one can see
We need change, we need it fast
Before rock's just part of the past
'Cause lately it all sounds the same to me
Oh, oh
Rock N'
Rock N' Roll Radio
Let's go
Will you remember Jerry Lee, John Lennon, T. Rex and Ol' Moulty?
It's the end of the 70's
It's the end of the century
Do you remember lying in bed
With your covers pulled up over your head?
Radio playin' so no one can see

Oh, oh

When I was a boy I thought about the times I'd be a man
I'd sit inside a bottle and pretend that I was in a can
In my lonely room I'd sit my mind in an ice cream cone
You can throw me if you wanna 'cause I'm a bone and I go
Oop-ip-ip oop-ip-ip, yeah!
If I don't start cryin' it's because that I have got no eyes
My father's in the fireplace and my dog lies hypnotized
Through a crack of light I was unable to find my way
Trapped inside a night but I'm a day and I go
Oop-ip-ip oop-ip-ip, yeah!
One...

I met her at the 7-11, yeah
Now I'm in seventh heaven
Tell me, tell me, can this be true?
I never thought I'd ever meet a girl like you
She was standing by the Space Invaders
So I said: Can I see you later?
Yeah we went for a little spin
Down to the Holiday Inn
We was young and in love
We was young and in love
And you're the only girl I'm ever thinking of
We went down to the record swap
The kids were dancing to the Blitzkrieg Bop
Bop-shoo-wop-shoo-wop-shoo-wop
Bop-shoo-wop-shoo-wop-shoo-wop
What ever happened to the radio
And where did all the fun songs go
Summer fun with the Beach Boys on
But we all know what went wrong
We was young and in love
We was young and in love
And you're the only girl I'm ever dreaming of
And so we went out to the dance
Which turned into a whole romance
And after just one night
I never thought that things could be so right
I kissed and hugged her and I said goodbye
Last thing I knew she wouldn't make it alive
Oncoming car went out of control
It crushed my baby and it crushed my soul
Now all I got is sorrow and pain
Standing out here in the rain
The crash, shattering glass, the sirens and pain
It's driving me insane
Oh, yeah, we was young and in love
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
We was young and in love
And you're the only girl I'm ever thinking of

Sleeping troubles all I have
Everything a board you
Sleeping troubles all I have
Took a little thing into bed
Watch your face smile again
You're in Rome, I feel it
You're in here, your story
Now I'm whispered to sleep at night
Even though it doesn't quite
Now in the dark, I am in bed
Now I'm sleeping with the dead
Sleeping troubles all I have

Spiderman, Spiderman, does whatever a spider can
Spins a web any size, catches thieves just like flies
Look out, here comes the Spiderman
Is he strong? Listen bud, he's got radioactive blood
Can he swing from a thread? Take a look overhead
Hey, there! There goes the Spiderman
In the chill of the night At the scene of a crime
Like a streak of light he arrives just in time
Spiderman, Spiderman, friendly neighborhood, Spiderman
Wealth and fame, he ignores, action is his reward
Look out, here comes the Spiderman
Spiderman, Spiderman, friendly neighborhood, Spiderman
Wealth and fame, he ignores, action is his reward
To him, life's a great big bang up, whenever there's a hang up
You'll find the Spiderman!

Everybody stares in this town
It's getting dangerous walking around
Hey you, looking at me
Do you make a worry?
Like I should have been
But you know you're useless
I've been through this before on the hard label
Nothing's gonna change
And I'll get my own
There's got to be, be a place
I'm a star and out of space
Hey you, looking at me
Do you make a worry?

But you know you're useless

What if i told you it was all meant to be?
Would you believe me? would you agree?
Its almost that feeling that we've met before
So tell me that you don't think I'm crazy
When I tell you love has come here and now
A moment like this
Some people wait a lifetime for a moment like this
Some people search forever for that one special kiss
Oh i cant believe it's happening to me
Some people wait a lifetime for a moment like this
Everything changes but beauty remains
Something so tender I can't explain
I may be dreaming but until I awake cant we make this dream last forever?
And ill cherish all the love we share
Could this be the greatest love of all?
I wanna know that you will catch me when I fall
So let me tell you this...
Some people wait a lifetime for a moment like this..
A moment like this
Some people wait a lifetime for a moment like this
Some people search forever for that one special kiss
Oh I cant believe it's happening to me
Some people wait a lifetime for a moment, a moment like this...
Oh I can't believe it's happening to me..some people wait a lifetime for a moment like this...

I ain't gonna give up on love
Love ain't gonna give up on me
I ain't gonna give up on love
Love ain't gonna give up on you and me
All those are painful memories, only brought me to my knees
I ain't gonna give up on love
Every beat of my heart baby, pounds with joy but not in vain
Every beat of my heart baby, pounds with joy but not in vain
All those are painful memories, only brought me to my knees
I ain't gonna
I ain't gonna give up on love
Little johnny taylor told us all, oh so long ago
What about the midnight crying'....woah that cheating' and lying'
What about the price that will....oh surely be paid
Oh when we gave up on love....love will surely have it's day
If we all just give up on love, yeah
I ain't gonna give up on love
Love ain't gonna, love ain't gonna, love ain't gonna,
Love ain't gonna give up on me
I ain't gonna give up, I ain't gonna give up
I ain't gonna, I ain't gonna, I ain't gonna, I ain't gonna give up on love
Everytime I try a little good love, good love, good love,
Good love just won't let me be

I don't want a lot for Christmas
There's just one thing I need
I don't care about the presents
Underneath the Christmas tree
I just want you for my own
More than you will ever know
Make my wish come true
Baby, all I want for Christmas is... You
I don't want a lot for Christmas
There's just one thing I need
I don't care about the presents
Underneath the Christmas tree
I don't want to hang my stocking
There upon the fireplace
Santa Claus won't make me happy
With a toy on Christmas day
I just want you for my own
More than you will ever know
Make my wish come true
Baby, All I want for Christmas is you
You baby
No, I won't ask for much this Christmas
I don't even wish for snow
I'm just gonna keep on waiting
Underneath the mistletoe
I won't make a list and send it
To the North Pole for Saint Nick
I won't even stay awake to
Hear those magic reindeers click
I just want you here tonight
Holding on to me so tight
What more can I do
Baby all I want for Christmas is you
Ooh baby
All the lights are shining
So brightly everywhere
And the sound of children's
Laughter fills the air
And everyone is singing
I hear those sleigh bells ringing
Santa won't you bring me the one I really need
Won't you please bring my baby back to me...
Oh I don't want a lot for Christmas
This is all I'm asking for and I
I just want to see my baby
Standing right outside my door
I just want you for my own
More than you will ever know
Make my wish come true
Baby all I want for Christmas is...
You
Baby, all I want for Christmas is you...

Uh, yeah
This song should start out
I remember like the Bobby Brown records
You'd hear the touch tone dialing
(Imitates phone dialing and ringing)
Hello?
Yo baby what's up girl
Yo girl I was thinking maybe I'd come over
And we'd take our relationship to the next level
And in the morning, girl I'm gonna pour you a bowl of Count Chocula
And I'm gonna pull some of the oat pieces out
So it taste like there's just more marshmallow
Cause that's how much I care about you girl
Girl I would change up the marshmallow to oat ratio for you
We've got the afternoon
You've got this room for two
One thing I'd love to do
Discover me
Discovering you
One mile to every inch of
Your skin like porcelain
One pair of candy lips and
Your bubblegum tongue
Cause if you want love
We'll make it
Swim in a deep sea of blankets
Take all your big plans
And bream them
This is bound to be a while
Cause your body is a wonderland
Your body is a wonder (I'll use my hands)
Your body is a wonderland
Something bout the way your hair falls in your face
And I love the shape you take when crawling towards the pillow case
You tell me where to go
And though I might leave to find it
I'll never let your head hit the bed
Without my hand behind it
And if you want love we'll make it
Swim in a deep sea of blankets
Take all your big plans and break them
This is bound to be awhile
Your body is a wonderland
Your body is a wonder (I 'll use my hands)
Your body is a wonderland
Damn baby
You frustrate me
I know you're mine all mine all mine
but you look so good it hurts sometimes
Your body is a wonderland
Your body is a wonderland
Your body is a wonderland
Your body is a wonderland
Do I have to tell the story
Of a thousand rainy days since we first met
Oh You know its a big enough umbrella
But it's always her that ends up getting wet
Dada da dada da da da
Dada da da da da da
Dada da dada da da da
Dada da da da da da
Thank You
To me
Do You care
Are you feeling good still?
The format of an acoustic guitar singer/songwriter
has yet top bore you
we;re all cool
Hell yeah
I like the yoo-hooing and the standing up
Because sometimes dave and i get off beat
And all we have to do is look at the ladies
Which isn't a bad thing
Cause they are always on
It only takes one of y'all

I call you up
You pick up
You call my bluff
On the card to love
You hold too close
Your hands to your chest
I can read your eyes
But I confess
It's lonely far from you, oh
Even when you're right by me
It's only why I wait for you
To take my hand
Why do I beg like a child for your candy?
Why do I come after you like I do, I love you?
Wherever you are
I swear
You be my angel
You
I play my cards the best I can
But I lose my luck when you're not here
My darling heart
Won't you please give in?
I may be strong
But I want you back again
When you're not here it's hard to pretend
It's all alright again
When you're not here love it's hard to pretend
It's all alright but still
Why do I beg like a child for your candy?
Why do I run after you like I do, I love you?
Whatever you are
I swear
You be my angel, you
Watch the deck
Count your cards
Makes no sense
That I'm always losing
When you're gone
Why do I beg like a child for your candy?
Why do I come after you like I do, I love you
Whatever you are
I swear
You'll be my angel, you
When you're gone

Friday night I'm going nowhere
All the lights are changing green to red
Turning over TV stations
Situations running through my head
Well looking back through time
You know it's clear that I've been blind
I've been a fool
To open up my heart
To all that jealousy, that bitterness, that ridicule
Saturday I'm running wild
And all the lights are changing red to green
Moving through the crowd I'm pushing
Chemicals all rushing through my bloodstream
Only wish that you were here
You know I'm seeing it so clear
I've been afraid
To show you how I really feel
Admit to some of those bad mistakes I've made
If you want it
Come and get it
Crying out loud
The love that I was
Giving you was
Never in doubt
Let go your heart
Let go your head
And feel it now
Babylon, Babylon
Sunday all the lights of London
Shining, sky is fading red to blue
I'm kicking through the Autumn leaves
And wondering where it is you might be going to
Turning back for home
You know I'm feeling so alone
I can't believe
Climbing on the stair
I turn around to see you smiling there
In front of me
If you want it
Come and get it
Crying out loud
The love that I was
Giving you was
Never in doubt
Let go your heart
Let go your head
And feel it now
Let go your heart
Let go your head
And feel it now
Let go your heart
Let go your head
And feel it now
Let go your heart
Let go your head
And feel it now
Babylon, Babylon, Babylon

So we were in the
Hot tub today:
There's a new sensation
Sweeping all the nation,
and they're calling it bare ballin it, bare ballin it.
Well i seem to have forgotten that crucial layer of cotton
I'm ballin it, we're all in it, we're bare ballin it,
There's nothing that you don't see,
After my jeans it's only just me.
Call me a "Fleshy Fernando",
I'm going commando!
I'm ballin it
There's a new sensation sweepin all the nation,
and they're callin it
(they're callin it)
they're callin it (they're callin it) bare ballin it

Your touch is electric
I felt it the first time you held me
The way we connected
So easily
I've tried to define it
Searched for the perfect phrase
I've tried to describe it
In a million different ways
(chorus)
It's joy, it's ecstacy, it's truth, it's destiny
And even love is not enough to tell you how you make me feel
There's only one word for this
I've got to admit it
You took my heart by surprise
Don't know how you did it
But baby, I've never felt so alive
(chorus)
It's joy, it's ecstacy, it's truth, it's destiny
And even love is not enough to tell you how you make me feel
There's only one word for this
It's bliss
Hey, you know, baby, know what the future holds
As long as you're here with me
(chorus)
It's joy, it's ecstacy, it's truth, it's destiny
And even love is not enough to tell you how you make me feel
It's faith, it's honesty, it's life, it's everything
To say "I love you"'s not enough to tell you how you make me feel
It's in your smile, in your kiss
It's the reason that I exist
There's only one word for this
It's bliss
It's bliss
It's bliss

When I'm standing in the sun
I never really stop to think and miss someone
But when I lose that light
Blue skies at night
When those evening stars shine down
I suddenly remember that you're not around
And I face that fight
Blue skies at night
These are the hardest kind of years
The ones where people disappear
So tired of all these broken dreams
I'm better on my own it seems
Dog in a ball at the end of my bed
Yet, I wish it was the three of us in yours instead
But I do what's right
Blue skies at night
These are the hardest kind of years
The ones where people disappear
Who's crying all these winter tears?
They're hanging like this chandelier
And there beside the morning grave
A stronger man in place of where a fool once laid
But for one more day
Blue skies
So come what may
Blue skies
I'll find my way
Blue skies at night

Catch a boat to england, baby,

Send out for whiskey, baby,

Me and room service, honey
Me and room service, babe

We're livin' a life of sin
When I ain't drinkin', baby
You are on my mind

Catch a boat to england, baby,

The blues run the game
Livin' is a gamble, baby
Lovin's much the same
Wherever I have played
Wherever I throw those dice
Wherever I have played
The blues run the game
Maybe when I'm older, baby
Someplace down the line
I'll wake up older
So much older, momma
Wake up older
And I'll just stop all my tryin'
Catch a boat to england, baby,
Maybe to spain
Wherever I have gone,
Wherever I've been and gone
Wherever I have gone
The blues are all the same

If melody
Is my destiny
Than what's left of me
I'll give to you...
And if next to me
Is all that you need to be
Would you settle for fantasy
If it's the best you could do?
Can I have my cake?
Can I have you too?
Would you follow me?
Could I ask you to?
Would the world between us
Break these ties?
We worked so hard
To realize...
Can a postcard say
What I see in your eyes?
Could I ever break away?
Would I be satisfied
And find peace inside
Rolling half my life
Over broken white lines?
Can I have my cake?
Can I have you too?
Would you follow me?
Could I ask you too?
Will I wake up one morning
And see your face
In the streaks on the window
That the rainstorm makes?
Could you bear all the waiting
And the strength that it takes?
Could I ever break away?
Could I ever break away?
Can I have my cake?
Can I have you too?
Would you follow me?
Could I ask you to?
Would the world between us
Break these ties?
We worked so hard to realize...
Can a postcard say
What I see in your eyes?
Could I ever break away?
Could I ever break away?
Away...
Away...
Away...

Buckets of rain
Buckets of tears
Got all them buckets comin' out of my ears.
Buckets of moonbeams in my hand,
You got all the love, honey baby,
I can stand
I've been meek
And hard like an oak
I seen pretty people disappear like smoke.
Friends will arrive, friends will disappear,
If you want me, honey baby,
I'll be here.
I like your smile
And your fingertips
I like the way that you move your lips.
I like the cool way you look at me,
Everything about you is bringing me misery.
Little red wagon
Little red bike
I ain't no monkey but I know what I like.
I like the way you love me strong and slow,
I'm takin' you with me, honey baby,
When I go.
Life is sad
Life is a bust
All ya can do is do what you must.
You do what you must do and ya do it well,
I'll do it for you, honey baby,
Can't you tell?

And leave your body alone
Somebody must change
You are the reason

Bought a ticket for a trip i wanted long ago
Staring deep into crying eyes
Said goodbye, stood in line
Now i changed my mind
I used to run and never look behind.
But now, now i've got a love to leave
And now, not gonna walk away so easily.
I can't take that plane
I can't take that
I can't take that plane today
I can't take that plane
I can't take that plane.
Plane lands short a man on the other side
Driver stands with a sign in faith
Checks his watch as he size up the time gone by
Two lonely pieces circle baggage claim.
But yeah, now i've got a love to leave
And yeah, don't you know it changes everything?
Everything...
I can't take that plane
I can't take that
I can't take that plane today
I can't take that plane
I can't take that plane.
No i can't
I can't
I can't
I can't...
I'm coming to getcha
I'm coming to getcha now
I'm coming to getcha
I'm coming to getcha now...

I am not done changing
Out on the run changing
I may be old and I may be young
But I am not done changing
I met me someone changing
We had some fun changing
Sometimes I wonder
Will she be the one when I am done changing?
Some of us stopped running
Some of us went home
Some of us dont got one
So we will build one of our own
Friends behind their fences
Looking at me strange
Wondering when I will come to my senses
But I am still changing
And I can't change my way
I see the sky changing
Reminds of mine changing
Wish I could tie me a rope around the sun
Cause I am not done changing
Time has been talking to me
Whispering in my ear
Saying follow your heart until it tears you apart
But hearts keep changing
Hearts keep changing
Hearts keep changing
Hearts keep changing
I am not done changing
Out on the run changing
I may be old and I may be young
But I am not done changing
Changing

How soft a whisper can get
When we're walking through a crowded space
I hear every word being said
I remember every day
That I get a little bit closer to you, you
How long an hour can take
When you're staring into open space
When I feel I'm slippin further away
I'll remember that every day
I get a little bit closer to you, you
To you, you
These are the days I won't get back
I won't hear you cry or hear you laugh
But when it's quiet and I don't hear a thing
Well I can always hear you sing
There's no where else that I have wanted to be
Then be there when you needed me
I'm sorry too but don't give up on me
And just remember when you were asleep
I got a little bit closer to you, you
To you, you
And then there's no where else I wanted to be
Then be there when you needed me
I'm sorry too but don't give up on me
And just remember when you were asleep
I got a little bit closer to you

Why won't you come baby?
Why won't you come when I call?
Why won't you come baby?
Why won't you come when I call?
I'm not up to something funny
I just wanna know you girl, is all
You got to know baby
Everybody's free sometime
You got to know baby
Everybody's free sometime
Could you get to spare a moment?
I can't seem to get you off my mind
Friday night you're busy
Something else to do
Saturday you're sleeping
You got work on Sunday too
Why won't you come baby?
Why won't you come when I call?
I'm not up to something funny
I just wanna know you girl, is all
Keep the motor running
Leave your jacket on
If I had my way
You would be drivin' home at dawn
Why won't you come baby?
Why won't you come when I call?
I'm not up to something funny
I just wanna know you girl, is all
Why won't you come baby?

Distance is the reason she and me don't really talk no more
It's written on my ticket information on the freezer door
Me, I'm not sorry I got what came coming for me
It's only everything I wanted all my life.
Love was made to get us to stay in quite a closer region
I wish my love could stay around a little more.
Distance, Distance, Distance
It's what it is, what it is now, now, now
Distance makes a woman want to hear I love you more than once.
If I could find a word that feels remotely like the feeling is.
Me, I'm still lucky I will not succumb to all of this.
It made temptation buy the women all my life.
If love was me, you'd never stay in all the closest ranges.
You'd never find a love that's closest all the time.
Distance, Distance, Distance, Distance
It's why I leave before I make myself say goodbye again
Goodbye Goodbye again
Distance makes a copy of my face she will bend inside her dreams.
Blood on all these clothes is from the telephonic surgeries.
Distance makes a man believe that loyalty is a thankless chore.
Loyalty's the reason I leave semen on my hotel floor, yeah.
Distance, Distance, Distance, yes
It's what it is, it's what it is, now, now, now, now

Freshman year,
Mom asks "What do you want to do
when you get out of here?"
I said, "Well, gee, I'm only 13,
but I think I'd like to play my guitar...
be a star."
"Well," she said, "that's not it,
you got time to go.
Good sense will kick in anytime, you know.
I'm not worried, I'm not worried."
Sophomore year,
she asked the same old thing,
my answer had remained unchanged.
I saw her fidget with her thumbs.
She said, "You like computers, John,
you like computers, don't you?
Yeah, I always see you with computers...
you like computers
maybe you could do something with computers.
Yeah, wouldn't that be nice?"
Junior year,
It's a little more intense,
She says, "What do you want to do with your life?"
I'm not on the fence, I know exactly what I aim to be,
and I'm only 17.
She said, "Well, all I ask, is that you pay attention in class,
so if you happen to change your mind in time,
you can still go somewhere reputable...
do us proud."
So I went downstairs,
and I played guitar loud.
Yeah, senior year,
Same old question,
She said, "What do you want to do?"
I said, "Play my guitar and sing."
She said, "There's no such thing."
She said, "There's no such thing..."
(speaking: I love you Mom)
"Welcome to the real world", she said to me
Condescendingly
Take a seat, take your life
Plot it out in black and white
Well, I never lived the dreams of the prom kings
And the drama queens
I'd like to think the best of me
Is still hiding up my sleeve
They love to tell you
Stay inside the lines
But something's better
On the other side
I wanna run through the halls of my high school
I wanna scream at the top of my lungs
I just found out there's no such thing as the real world
Just a lie you've got to rise above
So the good boys and girls take the so called right track
Faded hats
Grabbing credits
and maybe transfers
They listen to Phish, but they can't find the answers
And all of our parents
They're getting older
I wonder if they've wished for anything better
While in their memories
Tiny tragedies
They love to tell you
Stay inside the lines
Well, well something's better
On the other side
I wanna run through the halls of my high school
I wanna scream at the top of my lungs
I just found out there's no such thing as the real world
Just a lie you got to rise above
I am invincible..
You are invincible.. (yeah you are)
We are invincible..
As long as we're alive
Do I have to tell a story
of a thousand rainy days
since we first met?
It's a big enough umbrella
but it's always me
that ends up getting wet.
I wanna run through the halls of my high school
I wanna scream at the top of my lungs
I just found out there's no such thing as the real world
Just a lie you've got to rise above
I just can't wait til my 10 year reunion
I'm gonna bust down the double doors
And when I stand on these tables before you
You will know what all this time was for

Beautiful, i watch you try,
To see yourself through other's eyes.
But mirrors﻿ are a losing game,
They only show you backwards anyway.
The magic and the misery,
Come and go so easily.
But everything you'll ever be,
You already are to me.
And you were only five years old,
Playing princess in your mother's clothes.
Could you feel me standing next to you,
With my plastic sword and playground shoes.
Saying "if my dear i'm wrong somehow,
May dragons come and fell me now.
'cause everything you'll ever be,
You already are to me."
Why, i don't know why.
I don't know why you think you need to do it.
How, i don't know how.
I don't know how but i just sit back and i see my way right through it.
When the memories are ten feet tall,
Throwing shadows on your bedroom wall.
When you pull﻿ the shades and kill the lights,
Will you hear me singing out tonight?
Will you hear me singing out tonight?
Days are long and words are cruel,
But they won't get the best of you.
'cause everything you'll ever be,
You have always been to﻿ me.
Always been to me.

All here with me

More wasted funerals in time, in time

Midnight, lock all the doors
And turn off the lights
Feels like the end of the world
This Sunday night
There's not a sound
Outside the snow's coming down
Somehow I can't seem to find
The quiet inside my mind
Three oh two
The space in this room
Has turned on me
And all my fears
Have cornered me here
Me and my TV screen
The volume's down
Blue lights are dancing around
And still I can't seem to find
The quiet inside my mind
do do, do do do, hum...
Daylight is climbing the walls
Cars start, feet walk the halls
The world wakes and now I'm safe
At least by the light of day
At least by the light of day
Hmmm....

I must admit
I can't remember your name
I know we just met,
But since then I've had a lot to think about
Before we part ways,
Well, there's something that I'd like to say
I realize it's late
But if you'll hear out I'm sure
Dave Letterman can wait
And if you'd like to
Maybe continue,
What we started with a smile
From across the room
That'd be fine with me
When I first saw
Your face, I knew for sure
That from now on
Things would be different than before
I walk in weak
From yet another day
I need you to say
That tomorrow I'm gonna hear your voice again
And if you'd like to, maybe continue,
What we started with a smile
from across the room
That'd be fine with me
And I only hope that I can be what you were looking for
Cause all I ask is that you look my way
And that'd be fine with me
I know its clichéd
To use silly metaphors to describe the way
You handle me
But, I'm just an addict
I'm just and addict
And I think I'm hooked on you
And if you'd like to maybe continue
what we started with a smile
from across the room
that'd be fine with me
And I only hope that I can be what you were looking for
Cause all I ask is that you look my way
And that'd be fine with me
That'd be fine with me

Not talking about a year
No not three of four
I don't want that kind of forever
In my life anymore
Forever always seems to be around when it begins
But forever never seems to be around when it ends
So give me your forever
Please your forever
Not a day less will do
From you
People spend so much time
Every single day
Running around all over town
Giving their forever away
But no not me I won't let my forever roam
And now I hope I can find my forever a home
So give me your forever
Please your forever
Not a day less will do
From you
Like a handless clock with numbers
An infinite of time
No not the forever
Found only in the mind
Forever always seems to be around when things it begins
But forever never seems to be around when things it end
So give me your forever
Please your forever
Not a day less will do
From you

I lit out from reno, I was trailed by twenty hounds
Didn't get to sleep last night 'till the morning came around.
Set out runnin' but I take my time
A friend of the devil is a friend of mine
If I get home before daylight
I just might get some sleep tonight
Ran into the devil, babe, he loaned me twenty bills
I spent the night in utah in a cave up in the hills
Set out runnin' but I take my time
A friend of the devil is a friend of mine,
If I get home before daylight
I just might get some sleep tonight
I ran down to the level
But the devil caught me there
He took my twenty dollar
Bill and vanished in the air
Set out runnin' but I take my time
A friend of the devil is a friend of mine
If I get home before daylight
I just might get some sleep tonight
Got two reasons why I cry away each lonely night,
The first one's named sweet
Anne marie, and she's my hearts delight.
The second one is prison, babe, the sheriff's on my trail,
And if he catches up with me, I'll spend my life in jail
Got a wife in chino, babe, and one in cherokee
The first one says she's got my child
But it don't look like me
Set out runnin' but I take my time,
A friend of the devil is a friend of mine,
If I get home before daylight
I just might get some sleep tonight

Welcome to the real world,
She said to me, condescendingly.
Take a seat, take your life ...

Well, I never lived the dreams of the prom kings
And the drama queens.

Is still hiding up my sleeve.

I am invincible
You are invincible
We are invincible
As long as we're alive
We're alive...alive
See this shirt I'm wearin'?
Used to wear it all the time.
Workin' at a gas station,
Dreamin' about the sensation, of playin' for you, playin' for me.
Yeah, I gave the wrong change all the time --
Always ate the ho-ho's without payin a dime.
What they don't tell you is, you'll get a spare tire in time.
But I digress.
See I'm wearing that same shirt I wore back then.
And now I'm on stage playing for all yall.
What does that say to you?
Maybe one day I'll go back.
Maybe one day
It'll be some special promotional thing
When you fill up with at least eight gallons.
You get a special John Mayer CD sampler,
With a version of this song on it.
Don't apply theory to things
That inherently don't need theory at all.
Don't...
I wanna run through the halls of my high school
I wanna scream at the top of my lungs
I just found out there's no such thing as the real world
just a lie you've got to rise above

Look at yourself
If you had a sense of humor
You would laugh to beat the band
Look at yourself
Do you still believe the rumor
That romance is simply grand?
Since you took it right on the chin
You have lost that bright toothpaste grin
My mental state is all a jumble
I sit around and sadly mumble
Fools rush in
So here I am
Very glad to be unhappy
I can't win, so here I am
More than glad to be unhappy
Unrequited love's a bore
And I've got it pretty bad
When it's someone you adore
It's a pleasure to be sad
Like a straying baby lamb
With no mammy and no pappy
I'm so unhappy
But oh, so glad

Fold me up
Take me out
I'm portable
Fold me up
Take me out
I'm portable
I'm here on the road
I seem to have it all
We bolt it to the floor
Or we tape it to the wall
Fold it up
Fold it up
It's portable
Take me out
Fold me up
I'm portable
I put a map up on my ceiling
To fight that lonely feeling
In my bed
If you want to know what my life's about
Sometimes I'm here and I still freak out
It's just inside my head
The tape would not reveal a thing
Sometimes I'm looking around my back
To find the zipper and open it up and be twice my size
I want to find the highest peak
Stand up tall and with a shriek say "I'm alive"
Cause I can go anywhere
I can go anywhere
I can go anywhere
I can go anywhere
I said "Pull the bus over John"
He said "Why, do you got to pee soon"
I said "I want to sleep outside underneath the half full moon at night"
Cause I can go anywhere
I can go anywhere
I sing my songs
Confident in the knowledge that you'll be here to sing along
Fold me up
Take me out
Boy you know I'm portable

He Leaves home just like every morning
Saying goodbye to his son
A kiss on the cheek to the woman he loves
And its off to work for another day
Traffic jam outside the city
Leaves him anxious once again
He parks his car and rushes up the stairs
Puts his breifcase down and sits in his chair
Overlooking the town he calls home
And everyone is unaware
Then up from the frame of the picture on his desk
Of the family he loves
Uneasiness fills his chest
So he calls hiw wife just to tell her this:
Don't wait up for me tonight
Cuz I won't be coming home
And everything's gonna be alright
I just wanted you to know
I had to call you one last time
Just to rest your mind
Don't wait up for me tonight
Cuz I won't be coming home
And everythings gonna be alright
I just wanted you to know
Lets go out
People shout
People crying
Me, I'm trying
Mothers cry
Fathers die
And me, I'm still holding on
To you
To you
Lets go out
People shout
People crying
Me, I'm trying
Mothers cry
Fathers die
And me, I'm still holding on
To you
A few more words and I'm going to go
I can see the end from here
I love you I just wanted to say
Those three words to you today

I think I'm gonna stay home
Have myself a home life
Sitting in the slow-mo
And listening to the daylight
I am not a nomad
I am not a rocket man
I was born a housecat
By the slight of my mother's hand
I think I'm gonna stay home
I want to live in the center of a circle
I want to live on the side of a square
I used to be in my M-Z now
You'll never find me cause my name isn't there
Home life
Been holding out for a home life
My whole life
I want to see the end game
I want to learn her last name
Finish on a Friday
And sit in traffic on the highway
See, I refuse to believe
That my life's gonna be
Just some string of incompletes
Never to lead me to anything remotely close to a home life
Been holding out for the home life
My whole life
I can tell you this much
I will marry just once
And if it doesn't work out
Give her half of my stuff
It's fine with me
We said eternity
And I will go to my grave
With the life that I gave
Not just some melody line
On a radio wave
It dissipates
And soon evaporates
But home life doesn't change
I want to live in the center of a circle
I want to live on the side of a square
I'd love to walk to where we both can talk but
I've got to leave cause my ride is here
Home life
You take the home life
You keep the home life
I'll come back for the home life
I promise

I'm sitting in the railway station.
Got a ticket for my destination.
I just wanted to sing that before
I really knew that I didn't know the words.
Homeward bound,
I wish I was,
Homeward bound,
Home where my thought's escaping
Home where my music's playing,
Home where my love lies waiting
Silently for me.
I wanna keep going I just don't know the words.
Ev'ry day's an endless stream
Of cigarettes and magazines.
And each town looks the same to me, the movies and the factories
And ev'ry face I long to see reminds me that I long to be,
Homeward bound,
I wish I was,
Homeward bound,
Home where my thought's escaping,
Home where my music's playing,
Home where my love lies waiting
Silently, silently, so silently,
I sing with apologies, with apologies...

Speak, speak your mind
Your always telling me I need to open mine
And wait, wait your turn
Then shut me out cause you've got nothing left to learn

Oh, you say there's nothing wrong with being proud
So tell me what you love and say it loud
Now here's the dose that you've been dishing out
If you're listening this is how much it hurts
If you're listening this is how much it hurts
Oh, I'm wrong
I'm wrong again
But not because of where I stand but where I've been
And it burns
Oh, you know it burns like hell
To know there's nothing I can do but wish you well

You say there's nothing wrong with being proud
So tell me what you love and say it loud
I've been good enough to stay and hear you out
But you're wrong
You're never wrong
Oh, you say there's nothing wrong with being proud
Ya, so tell me what you love and say it loud
I've been giving you the benefit of the doubt
If you're listening this is how much it hurts
If you're listening this is how much it hurts
If you're listening this is how much it hurts
If you're listening this is how much it hurts

I don't need no doctor
'Cause I know
What's ailing me
I don't need no doctor
No, no
'Cause I know
What's ailing me
I've been too long away
From my baby, ahh
I'm coming down
With a misery
(I don't need no doctor)
(I don't need no doctor)
I don't need no doctor
For my prescription
To be filled
(I don't need no doctor)
(I don't need no doctor)
I don't need no doctor
I tell ya now
For my prescription
To be filled
(I don't need no doctor)
(I don't need no doctor)
Only my baby's arms
Could ever take away
This chill
(I don't need no doctor)
(I don't need no doctor)
Now the doctor
Say I need rest
(hey hey)
Before I need
Her tenderness
(hmmm hmm)
Put me
On the critical list
(hey hey)
When all I need
Is her sweet kiss
(hmmm hmm)
He gave me
A medicated lotion
But it didn't soothe
(It didn't soothe)
My emotion
(I don't need no doctor)
(I don't need no doctor)
I don't need no doctor
For my hope
To live is gone
(I don't need no doctor)
(I don't need no doctor)
I don't need no doctor
No, no
Wahhh
My hope to live is gone
(I don't need no doctor)
(I don't need no doctor)
All I need is my baby
Baby, please
Won't you please
Come on home
(I don't need no doctor)
You know
What I'm talkin' about?
(I don't need no doctor)
I don't need no aspirins
(I don't need no doctor)
I don't need no lotion
(I don't need no doctor)
I say, I don't need
No vitamin pills

I don't need no lotion
(I don't need no doctor)

No vitamin pills

No I'm not the man I used to be lately
See you met me at an interesting time
And if my past is any sign of your future
You should be warned before I let you inside
Hold on to whatever you find baby
Hold on to whatever will get you through
Hold on to whatever you find baby
I don't trust myself with lovin' you
I will beg my way into your garden
Then I'll break my way out when it rains
Just to get back to the place where I started
So I can want you back all over again
(I don't really understand)
Hold on to whatever you find baby
Hold on to whatever will get you through
Hold on to whatever you find baby
I don't trust myself with lovin' you
Who do you love?
Girl I see through, through your love
Who do you love?
Me or the thought of me?
Me or the thought of me?
Hold on to whatever you find baby
Hold on to whatever will get you through
Hold on to whatever you find baby
I don't trust myself with lovin' you
Hold on to whatever you find baby

In the wee small hours of the morning
While the whole wide world is fast asleep
You lie awake and think about the girl
And never even think of counting sheep
When your lonely heart has learned its lesson
You'd be hers if only she would call
In the wee small hours of the morning
That's the time you miss her most of all
When your lonely heart has learned its lesson
You'd be hers if only she would call
In the wee small hours of the morning
That's the time you miss her most of all

Dah, dah, dah

Hang ups, let downs
Bad breaks, set backs
Natural fact is
I can't pay my taxes
Oh, make me wanna holler
And throw up both my hands
Yea, it makes me wanna holler
And throw up both my hands
Crime is increasing
Trigger happy policing
Panic is spreading
God know where we're heading
Oh, make me wanna holler

Everybody thinks we're wrong
Who are they to judge us
Simply cause we wear our hair long

Deck the halls with boughs of holly
Fa la la la la
La la la la
Tis the season to be jolly
Fa la la la la
La la la la
Outside the carollers start to sing
I can't describe the joy they bring
Cause joy is something they don't bring me
My girlfriend is by my side
On the roof are hanging 'sicles of ice
Their tiny voices get irritating
Its Christmas time again
So I stand with a dead smile on my face
Wondering how much of my time they'll waste
Oh, God, I hate these Satan's helpers
And then I guess I must have snapped
Because I grabbed a baseball bat
And made them all run for shelter
It's Christmas time again
It's time to be nice to the people you can't stand
All year
I'm growing tired of all this Christmas cheer
You people scare me
Please stay away from my home
If you don't want to get me down, just leave the presents
And then leave me alone
Well, I guess it's not cool to freak on Christmas Eve
Cause the cops came and arrested me
They had an unfair advantage
And even though the jail didn't have a tree
Christmas came a night early
A guy named Bubba unwrapped my package
It's Christmas time again
It's time to be nice to the people you can't stand
All year
I'm growing tired of all this Christmas cheer
You people scare
Please stay away from my home
If you don't want to get me down,just leave the presents
And then leave me alone
I won't be home
I won't be home for Christmas
I won't be home
I won't be home for Christmas
I won't be home
I won't be home for Christmas
I won't be home
I won't be home for Christmas
I won't be home
I won't be home for Christmas

Jingle bell
Jingle bell
Jingle bell rock
Jingle bells swing
And jingle bells ring
Snowing and blowing up bushels of fun
Now the jingle hop has begun
Jingle bell
Jingle bell
Jingle bell rock
Jingle bells chime in jingle bell time
Dancing and prancing in jingle bell square
In the frosty air
What a bright time
Its the right time
To rock the night away
Jingle bell time is a swell time
To go riding in a one horse sleigh
Giddy up jingle horse
Pick up your feet
Jingle around the clock
Mix and a mingle
And a jingling beat
Thats the jingle bell
Thats the jingle bell
Thats the jingle bell rock

He broke my heart
And now its raining
Just to rub it in
I'm at your door
I feel so crazy about it
You'll say i told you so
You saw it long ago
You knew he had to go
I finally came around
I'm back on solid ground
Can't let it get me down
Its alright, its alright, its alright
Its alright
Its alright, its alright, its alright
Yes i was burned, but i call it a lesson learned
Mistake overturned, so i call it a lesson learned
My soul has returned so i call it a lesson learned
Another lesson learned
Sometimes, some lies
Can take a minute to fully realize
His tears, your eyes
Thirty seconds to apologize
You'll give him one more chance
Just like the time before
But he already knows
You'll give 100 more
Until that night in bed
You'll wake up in a sweat
You're racing to the door
Can't take it anymore
I was burned but i call it a lesson learned
Mistake overturned, so i call it a lesson learned
My soul had returned so i call it a lesson learned
Another lesson learned
Lifes perfect, it ain't perfect if you don't know what the struggles for
Falling down ain't fallin down if you don't cry when you hit the floor
It's called the past cause i'm gettin past
And i ain't nothing like i was before.
You ought to see me now
Yes i was burned, but i call it a lesson learned
Mistake, i returned so i called it a lesson learned
My soul has returned so i call it a lesson learned
Another lesson learned
Wooooaaa

You can stand beside him
When he's walking down that road.
But you can't try and stop him
When he wonders where it goes.

Let the world the boy as he is
Let the boy see the world if he wants to
If he wants to

I'm writing you to
Catch you up on places I've been
To whom it may concern
I refuse to be another being on this earth
I'm breathing for a purpose
I wanna be the center piece of my entire culture
And I've been thinking about you
Cause you've done such
By doing such
I get a pen and paper
Write you a letter cause you are appreciated
I'm dreaming to be great
While working on my mistakes
You promise that's change
I'm doing the same thing
Dear Mr.Obama
I'm hoping that this letter reaches you
in good spirits
Lord knows you've been busy
But I just wanna know if I speak could you listen
We in the same city I was hoping I could visit ya
If not I'm hoping that this letter could convey how I'm feeling
And you could find interest
First off congratulations on the win
It's time for some change to commence
I gotta question for you man
From an African American stance
Are we expecting to much from your four year plan
And what about the rappers
That happen to act like a black president
Give us a right to be assholes
You know
They say your name for attention
But little to no interest after election
or the too cheap t-shirt sellers
That's making revenue of a name we cherish
As I end this letter
One more thing
I hope you understand your impact on our race
Sincerely Wale
P.S Eh I ain't trying to nit pick
But keep them cigarettes away
I'm writing you to
Catch you up on places I've been
You have this letter
Finally got excited
But there's nothing else inside
To whom it may concern
I refuse to be another being on this earth
See I'm breathing for a purpose
I need to be the center piece of my entire culture
And I've been thinking bout you
Cause you've done such
By doing such
I get a pen and paper
Write you a letter cause you are appreciated
Like damn mama the reason I work hard
not even my favorite rapper
you was bigger than an artist
Yeah 'Pac
I was twelve when the gunned you
Wish you was around now to see what I've become see
You never had a son
As if it was a literal but ,
Years later there's still a bunch of little you's
Never seen you as lyrical
But more as a voice that the whole culture would listen to
Speakin the truth
Like only you can do
It's only right we lose greatness at its pinnacle
I got a question for ya
Little somethin to say
Are you still mad at Biggie ?
Are you still mad at Dre ?
And are you happy at the way your legacy portrayed ?
I'm trying to do for D.C what you did for L.A
But music today
It's getting lame for us
They chasing fame rather than making a change for us
They stop being artists
They stop being honest
They want that club shit
Ain't no more damn mama's
And you don't know me
But knowin you through music is going to change the world
In the future
Truly yours , Wale
P.S Hey how long will they mourn you forever in the day ?
I'm writing you to
Catch you up on places I've been
You have this letter
Finally got excited
But there's nothing else inside
So I'm writing you this letter
And I can only hope that you read it if you get it
Hoping if you get it that you won't ever forget it
You won't never forget it
You won't never forget it (x2)
I'm writing you to
Catch you up on places I've been
You have this letter
Finally got excited
But there's nothing else inside (x2)

Saw you sleeping on the couch tonight
Though it serves you right
Makes you luckier than I
All the colors in the room have changed
The painting yesterday
Brother I discovered you
We're pushing on
We're passing through
It won't be long
'Til I walk with you
Tonight I'm down
I'm inside out
Staring at the pictures of the album you forgot about
Isn't it a shame?
Times have changed
But isn't it strange?
Lifelines stay the same
We're never where we want to be
But that's ok with me
'It's just the way it is', we say
It feels like makebelieve
You know that you're my history
Brother, I rediscovered you
We're pushing on
We're passing through
It won't be long
'Til I walk with you
Tonight I'm down
I'm inside out
Staring at the pictures in the album you forgot about
Isn't it a shame?
Times have changed
But isn't it strange?
Lifelines stay the same
Round and round
Can't believe my heart has waited this long
All along we've been children
In a cold world where wonder was
Lost everyday
If love was a compass
Oh I've lost my way

Well I'll never forget the first time that I heard
That pretty mouth say that dirty word
And I can't even remember now what she backed my truck into
But she covered her mouth and her face got red
And she just looked so darn cute
That I couldn't even act like I was mad
Yeah, I live for little moments like that
Well that's just like last year on my birthday
She lost all track of time and burnt the cake
And every smoke detector in the house was goin' off
And she was just about to cry until I took her in my arms
And I tried not to let her see me laugh
Yeah, I live for little moments like that
I know she's not perfect but she tries so hard for me
And I thank God that she isn't 'cause how boring would that be
It's the little imperfections it's the sudden change in plans
When she misreads the directions and we're lost but holdin' hands
Yeah, I live for little moments like that
When she's layin' on my shoulder on the sofa in the dark
And about the time she falls asleep so does my right arm
And I want so bad to move it 'cause it's tinglin' and it's numb
But she looks so much like an angel that I don't wanna wake her up
Yeah, I live for little moments
When she steals my heart again and doesn't even know it
Yeah, I live for little moments like that

Can't get over
My dog rover
Got run over
Four leaf clover
Not so lucky little puppy
You got f'd up by a trucky
Picked you up on a friday
You were flat on the driveway
If I could have it my way
You would have died on the highway

"The best thing about being on the road is that now I can write my big road opus.
I can write my big song about being on the road, which I couldnt do.
Cuz every artist has to have that sort of like..."
I strolled into town on a Friday night
Another lonely town
Did I mention that it's a brand new town on this Friday night?
It's the town that I'm referring to
When I refer to this town
The coffee's stale
And the cigarettes have...tobacco in them
And...lightening. . .

I can feel your body
When Im lying in my bed
Theres too much confusion
Running round through my head
Its making me so angry
To know that the flame will always burn
When will I get over
When will I ever learn, ever learn
Old Love, leave me alone
Old Love, go on home
I can see your face
But i know that its not real
just an illusion
caused by how i used to feel
And its making me so angry
Knowing the flame will always burn
When will I get over
Come on, when will I ever learn
Old love, leave me alone
Old love, go on home
Old love, love
Old love

Go tell your friends

If they don't laugh right at you
They just as fucked (sometimes he says messed) up as you is

Violet skies
10 AM
Falling on
My knees again
Outside in the underground
Proud the rain
I'm walking a straight line
Stepped on all of the cracks this time
I don't care i'm not movin aside
For anyone
Outside in the undergroud
Proud the rain
Outside in the underground
Theres no way out of here today
I raise my head up to the sky again
And make my way alone
I'm never home, but i stopped searching
'cause the city told me so
It all comes down
Down to me
Oh i've got a hundred lives
Oh i've got to get it right
Oh who knows someday i might
Oh (i've got to get it right)
Outside in the undergroud
Proud the rain
Outside in the underground
Theres no way out of here today, oh no way
I raise my head into the sky again
And make my way alone
I'm never home, but i stopped searching
'cause the city told me
It all comes down
Down to me
Oh i've got a hundred lives
Oh i've got to get it right
Oh who knows someday i might
Oh i've got to get it right

Baby, you could jump a hundred times
There's just no way that you'll ever fall out of my graces, out of my graces
Let's say for a second that you ever do
And it gets hard to look at you
Time will erase it, time will erase it
You can use me up, kick me down
As much as you like, we're good on time
Cause, guess who desperately wants you, over and over
Over and over
Guess who desperately wants you, over and over
Over and over
You can cut your hair just to grow it back
Or dye it till the shade turns black
I'll recognize you, I'll recognize you
When you lose your way and I'm doing fine
I'll even lose my place in line
I'll help you find it, I'll help you find it
Cause, guess who desperately wants you, over and over
Over and over
Guess who desperately wants you, over and over
Over and over
Fadeout
Cry at the hands of you before I laughed at something new
Cause over and over, I'm breaking my heart just to save your own

Was a time when I wasn't sure
But you set my mind at ease
There is no doubt you're in my heart now
Said, "woman, take it slow and it'll work itself out fine
All we need is just a little patience"
Said, "sugar, make it slow and we'll come together fine
All we need is just a little patience"
Patience, mm... Yeah
I sit here on the stairs 'cause I'd rather be alone
If I can't have you right now, I'll wait, dear
Sometimes I get so tense, but I can't speed up the time
But you know, love, there's one more thing to consider
Said, "woman, take it slow and things will be just fine
You and I'll just use a little patience"
Said, "sugar, take the time 'cause the lights are shining bright
You and I've got what it takes to make it
We won't fake it, oh, I'll never break it
'Cause I can't take it"
(Whistle)
(Little patience, mm, yeah, mm, yeah)
(Need a little patience, yeah...)
(Just a little patience, yeah...)
(Some more patience, yeah...)
I've been walking the streets at night
Just tryin' to get it right (need some patience, yeah...)
It's hard to see with so many around
You know, I don't like being stuck in the crowd
(Could use some patience, yeah...)
And the streets don't change but, baby, the names
I ain't got time for the game (gotta have some patience, yeah...)
'Cause I need you yeah, yeah, but I need you, ooh
(All it takes is patience, yeah...)
I need you, ooh... (just a little patience, ooh...)
I need you, ooh... (is all you need)

Today was hard but I've made my way
And I've found the strength to say
That I don't belong and I'm holding on
And I smile, I yawn, I play along
But all I know by now
Is you don't belong and I'm holding on
You know I really can't take this place
I've got to shuffle up all this scenery around me
I'm never finishing what I started
Oh I was born with a portable heart
There was a flight that left tonight
And lived for the dawn that I should've been on
Cause I could've been gone and asleep already
You know I really can't take this place

Think of your fellow man
Lend him a helping hand
Put a little love in your heart.
You see it's getting late
Oh please don't hesitate
Put a little love in your heart.
And the world will be a better place
And the world will be a better place
For you and me
You just wait and see
Another day goes by
And still the children cry
Put a little love in your heart.
If you want the world to know
We won't let hatred grow
Put a little love in your heart.
And the world will be a better place
And the world will be a better place
For you and me
You just wait and see
Take a good look around and
If you're lookin' down
Put a little love in your heart
I hope when you decide
Kindness will be your guide
Put a little love in your heart.
And the world will be a better place
And the world will be a better place
For you and me
You just wait and see
Put a little love in your heart....

Don't know why Victoria came by
But I could see by the look in her eyes
Victoria'd been driving round the town for a while
Playing with the thought of leaving
Don't know why Victoria just smiled
Mentioned somethig bout how you were right
Must have been hard to see through the tears she was hiding
She said, "I might not be seeing him soon,
Got a few things I've been waiting to do."
Hey, Victoria came by
Victoria came by tonight
Hey, Victoria came by
She says to say goodbye
Looked outside at the car in the drive
And the suitcase on the back seat inside
Sure it's so she can look out behind at the road
She said, "I might not be seeing him soon,
Got a few things I've been waiting to do."
Hey, Victoria came by
Victoria came by tonight
Hey, Victoria came by
She says to say goodbye
Don't look down
She seemed all right
You might be asking, where is Victoria tonight
Somewhere out on the highway
I'm sure that she's fine

You know those days before I met you
Well good cause I don't either
It's almost like they were meant to
Make the whole thing sweeter
You think I'm just a boy who's
Consumed by all his fears
The fact that you should have seen me
Same time last year
Same time last year
Oh the same time last year
Living fifteen over
Shortly over the nick of time
I'm sad like a boy
But I smile like a man
Its the best way that I never understand
I wish I would have made it
I hate the view from here
I didn't think I'd think I'd saw my wife that summer
That same time last year
Oh the same time last year

She's a mystery
There's something in her eyes that always gets to me
A hazy mixture of green and gold
And watching her it never gets old
She's a mystery, a mystery to me
The way she walks when she talks to me
Along the paths in the rainy days
The clouds that are falling and storming
Are blown away
She's a mystery, a mystery to me
When she looks at me
I feel myself getting weak in the knees
And my voice quivers and my heart shivers
Cause she makes me see
She makes me see, the real me
She's a mystery, a mystery to me
She's a mystery, she's a mystery, a mystery

We were fine this morning
Now i feel like i'm dreaming
You try to tell me what's happened
But i can't hear when you're screaming
No more "i'm sorry"'s
I don't have the time
You break up to make up
So spare me the lie
Shut up and love me
Cause you've already got me
I don't need words
I need time in your arms
I need love from you, baby
You knew it's not right
We could've been smiling
You should've been the light inside my eyes
And i shouldn't have been crying
Oh, no
Don't say you need me
Don't promise to change
I know that you need me
There's nothing to say
Shut up and love me
Cause you've already got me
I don't need words
I need time in your arms
I need love from you, baby
Shut up and love me
Cause you've already got me
Cause i don't need words
And as much as it hurts
I need love from you, baby
And how can you be
Too blind to see
The girl who stands before you
Who wants you more than anything
Shut up and love me
Cause you've already got me
I don't need words
I need time in your arms
I need love from you, baby
Shut up and love me

Is there any way to know when it's over?
When will you show her?
Will you be done?
Is there any day that slowly rolls over
That will know that your last war was won
How will you ever know?
How will you know . . .
How will you ever know when you're
Sleeping at the crash site
Walkin on the wreckage
Somebody's past life, another one's older
Where the fire burned, the grass began to grow
Nobody walks there, everybody knows that
OOhhh . . .
How will you know?
Simmering . . .
How will you know,
How will you know?
Is there anyone who pulled it off easy
Spoke what they were thinking and
Moved on to the next city and
Is there anyone who let them down gently and
Moved on to the next, I don't know
How will you know?
Ooohh
How will you know?
That you been
Sleeping at the crash site
Resting on the wreckage
Somebody's past life
Somebody's old love
Resting on the wreckage
Somebody's old love
Somebody's old love
People have the right to fly
And will when it gets compromised
I was gonna play "Wheel" but now I changed my mind
Sleepin' at the crash site . . .
Sleepin' at the crash site . . .
Sleepin' at the crash site . . .
Restin on the wreckage
So much old love
So much old love
I can feel your body when I'm lying in my bed
There's too much confusion running round through
Runnin round through . . .

It is exactly the same as it has always been
Be any secret of our way there
I know, something called my name.
The correct way more strange
My soul burns
I want to have more than you have there.
Because who sends this piece, dear!
It is someone from outside!
It is better you run, pq it will find you
And believe when I say it is contagious!
Only a third of what I should know
It is more than we can see, always
More does not mean that long
It should burn like yesterday
" Stop me confused "
Except that I think you should know before you go
Because who sends this piece, dear!
It is someone from the outside
Not anticipated run...
The system works for everyone
Everything as it should be
My soul burns!
I want to have more than you have there.
Because who sends this piece, dear!
It is someone from outside
Someone from outside.
Someone from the outside

Here, comes the cold
Break out the winter clothes
And find a love to call your own
You...enter you
Your cheeks a shade of pink
And the rest of you in powder blue
Who knows, what will be?
But I'll make you this guarantee
No way November will see our goodbyes
When it comes to December it's obvious why
No one wants to be alone at Christmas time
In the dark, on the phone
You tell me the names of your brothers
And your favorite colors...I'm learning you
And when, it snows again
We'll take a walk outside
And search the sky, like children do (I'll say to you..)
No way November will see our goodbyes
When it comes to December it's obvious why
No one wants to be alone at Chrismas time
Come January, we're frozen inside
Making new resolutions a hundred times
February won't you be my valentine?
And we'll both be safe till St. Patrick's day
We should take a ride tonight around the town
And look around at all the beautiful houses
Something in the way the blue light's on the black night
Can make you feel more
Everybody it seems to be
Just wants to be, just like you and me
No one wants to be alone at Christmas time
Come January we're frozen inside
Making new resolutions a hundred times
February won't you be my valentine?
And if our always is all that we gave
And we someday, take that away
I'll be alright...if it was just till St. Patrick's Day

Exactly how you hear it, is exactly how it all went down…
It was later in the evening
That the facts and the figures got turned around
True, there was a woman
Yes, she did advance my way
And I can't be sure exactly but I swear I saw her say my name
It was the right time
She was the real thing
I had to walk away
(See) Don't wanna be, stitched up out of my mind
Feeling strung out, laggin' behind
All trapped in, can't do a thing because I'm
Locked down
Stitched up, feeling the burn
All strung out, I finally learn that
Trapped in, can't do a thing because I'm
Locked down
I wonder where she came from
I wonder where she's gotta go
Who's to say she's single
And who's to say she's on her own
Girls like that don't sleep alone
(Alright here's the thing, here's the thing)
That girl is flawless, and I know I'm not the first one to think that
And since I'm not the first, I sure won't be the last
I'd spend my whole life looking behind my back
I just don't think I'm up to that
Stitched up, out of my mind
Feeling strung out, laggin' behind
All trapped in, can't do a thing because I'm
Locked down
Stitched up, feeling the burn
All strung out, I finally learn that
Trapped in you can't do a thing because you're
Locked down
Stitched up, out of my mind
Feeling strung out, laggin' behind
All trapped in, I can't do a thing because I'm
Locked down
Stitched up, feeling the burn
All strung out, I finally learn that
Trapped in you can't do a thing because you're
Locked down
Locked down
Stitch me up, string me out
Trap me in, lock me down
Stitch me up, string me out
Trap me in, lock me down
I don't wanna be
Stitch me up, string me out
Trap me in, lock me down
Stitch me up, string me out
Trap me in, lock me down
Because I'm down and down and down (Ooo)

On a sailboat
I am slowly
Floating nowhere
Lost the memories
Of where I am and why
Black ocean churning
A million stars
Are burning
Planetariums were right
About the sky
Once upon a day
I set off on a journey
Wishing on the wind
Take me far from home
Now I'm on the waves
And I'm taking on water
Hard to see
I won't always be alone
There was a time
When August sun was high
And centered on me
But it did me on my back
And settled down
Used to scream
Through the land
Used to size it
In my head
But it fell
Behind the line
That leads to sky
Once upon a day
I set off on a journey
Wishing on the wind
Take me far from home
Now I'm on the waves
And I'm taking on water
Hard to see
I won't always be alone
Inside this storm
Whipping in the wind
My sail is torn
In other words
The ends
Are never not my own
Hard to see
I won't always be alone
I'm a sailboat out of here
Slowly floating nowhere
Then someday
I'll wash upon
Someone else's shore

My sisters and I
Have this wish before we die
And it may sound strange
As if our minds are deranged
So don't ask us why
Beneath the sheltering sky
We have this strange obsession
You have the means in your possession
Tea in the Sahara with you
Tea in the Sahara with you
The young man agreed
He would satisfy their need
So they danced for his pleasure
With a joy you could not measure
But he'd never return
So the sisters would burn
And his shelter in the sky
Of the desert he would fly
Tea in the Sahara with you
Tea in the Sahara with you
Tea in the Sahara with you
Tea in the Sahara with you
Tea in the Sahara with you
Tea in the Sahara with you
Tea in the Sahara with you
Tea in the Sahara with you

I know its early
And you harldy even know me but
I want your love so bad, so bad
I'm bound to fuck it up
Could you tell me what to say?
You must have heard that line about your eyes a million times
And now your holding out to hear about your chin
I bet that that could get me in, let me in
Could you tell me what to say?
Tell me what to say?
When you were young and playing princess in your mother's dress
Into the mirror dreaming what your prince would say
I know you still remember to this day
Could you tell me what to say?
And sure its not fair
I might lose all self respect
Those who say I should be myself
They have obviously never met you yet
I can tell by the way your eyes roll
The way you stab the ice in your glass
That its over
I can see you signaling to a friend
Whispering make this end
You should have told me what to say
Tell me what to say
Tell me what to say
(It's very primative still)

I'm a good man
In a dark room
In a big town under a full Moon
It's a Friday
And I'm almost home
I'm in a good place
Full of head space
Got a brand new pack in my suitcase
But it's dinner and
Then it's bed alone
How do you break a mended heart?
I'm bored and want something to do
I wanna fall, fall asleep
Asleep in the arms
The arms of a woman
A woman who doesn't
Doesn't deserve my love
I wanna lie, lie to myself
Myself and someone else
Just to feel something
Something that hurts me
The hurt makes me feel alive
Gonna make it
Like I need her
Gonna miss her the moment I meet her
And it's only gonna get worse from there
I'll be rappin
In the shower
She'll be here by the end of the hour
I can do better
But I can't do better now
How do you break a mended heart?
I'm bored and want something to do
I wanna fall, fall asleep
Asleep in the arms
The arms of a woman
A woman who doesn't
Doesn't deserve my love
I wanna lie, lie to myself
Myself and someone else
Just to feel something
Something that hurts me
The hurt makes me feel alive
So long
It's over
Nice to skip the chance to get to know you
Why did I think this was true?
Because I wanted to
I wanna fall, fall asleep
Asleep in the arms
The arms of a woman
A woman who doesn't
Doesn't deserve my love
I wanna lie, lie to myself
Myself and someone else
Just to feel something
Something that hurts me
The hurt makes me feel alive
I wanna fall
I wanna kneel
I wann lie, cry, say goodbye
Beg, lie, cheat and steal

This will all make perfect sense someday
I'll be A-Okay
All my bills have all gone paid
I crashed the car again
I broke the bank
This could've been a slow song
A laundry list of all my wrongs
But at the end of the day
This is my beautiful disaster piece I've made
Gonna laugh I know the pain is here
This will all make perfect sense someday
I'll be A-Okay
There's got to be a reason for the rain
I don't understand the numbers
But my faith is in the math
And come someday these twisted ties will tangle
And we'll look back and laugh
And to all the hearts I've broken
And the ones that once broke mine
I've got suspicions, all will be forgiven in time
Gonna look you in the eye and say
This will all make perfect sense someday
I'll be A-Okay
There's got to be a reason for the rain
And if it ever gets bad
I mean stay in bed bad
I'll move to Nova Scotia
Forget the life I had
I'll be up at 9 each morning
Down by the shore
Collecting things that fell off boats in storms
Well, ok, so I might never
But it's nice to know the option's there
This will all make perfect sense someday
I'll be A-Okay
There's got to be a reason for the rain
And it doesn't help
That I keep biting my lip in the same place

Give a stretch
And wipe the dreams from my eyes
Close your eyes and imagine me on a typical day
Well I sit back and just close my eyes
And I drift away
To a place that's in my mind
I'll read a book or I'll watch tv
It helps me to forget about all the little things

On a typical da da da day da da day ay

Basically nothin' has changed
She explained
We're so happy you're home again
You take the winter
To get back on your feet
Your bed is bein' made
And your father washed the sheets for you
So we talked a while
About all my woes
Their smiles worse than I told you so's
When she said to wash up and get to bed
I knew the freedom I had learned
I'd learn quickly to forget
And nobody understands
And nobody seems to care
'Bout the compromise of a man
Comin' home after five long years
Givin' up after five long years
Unpacked my bags in the livin' room
Smell the last of a sweet perfume
Came from the girl that went with the world that I traded in today
Just to live a safer way
And nobody understands
And nobody seems to care
'Bout the compromise of a man
Comin' home after five long years
Givin' up after five long years
She says you're always welcome here
You'll never be alone
Perhaps that's now my greatest fear
I'll always call this home
This home

Well, I'm standing here, freezing, inside your golden garden
Uh got my ladder, leaned up against your wall
Tonight's the night we planned to run away together
Come on dolly mae, there's no time to stall
But now you're telling me...
I think we better wait till tomorrow
I think we better wait till tomorrow
I think we better wait till tomorrow
Got to make sure it's right, so until tomorrow, goodnight.
Oh, dolly mae, how can you hang me up this way ?
Oh, on the phone you said you wanted to run off with me today
Now I'm standing here like some turned down serenading fool
Hearing strange words stutter from the mixed mind of you
And you keep tellin' me that ah...
I think we better wait till tomorrow
I think we better wait till tomorrow
No, can't wait that long
I think we better wait till tomorrow
Got to make sure it's right, until tomorrow, goodnight, oh.
Let's see if I can talk to this girl a little bit here...
Ow ! dolly mae, girl, you must be insane
So unsure of yourself leaning from your unsure window pane
Do I see a silhouette of somebody pointing something from a tree ?
Click bang, what a hang, your daddy just shot poor me
And I hear you say, as I fade away...
We don't have to wait till tomorrow
We don't have to wait till tomorrow
We don't have to wait till tomorrow

Only a nascent trying to harness huge fire
Out on the beach in the darkness starting bonfire
So gorgeous, a man might cry
Burning trees in the basement start a cool fire
Feel my heartbeat racing, baby you're on fire
So gorgeous, a man might cry
Back in paris you told me you were suicidal
It's not a vacation if I lose you to eiffel
You're gorgeous but you can't fly
A hidden admirer sent me roses white as fire
We took our handfuls it was war, flower fighter

It's been so long
since I've seen you.
And I miss your smile
and I miss your face,
'cause you haven't been around my place.
It's been so long
since I've seen you.
And I miss the smell of skin and your hair,
and the way you genuinely care
about me.
And I don't want these feelings to change.
I want our love to always remain, because
without you,
I wouldn't be the same.
Without you...
And I can't explain
How I feel inside,
Every time I try to tell you
My words always fall short,
But showin' you what you mean
to me.
And I can't explain
how I feel inside;
the way you mesmerize me,
and how you hypnotize me,
with your eyes.
With your eyes.
And I don't want these feelings to change.
I want our love to always remain, because
without you,
I wouldn't be the same.
So don't ever run away.
Here beside me is where you'll stay, because
without you,
I could not remain.
Without you...

I was supposed to be
The heartbreaker
I was the one who
was supposed to survive
I wanted to break your heart
Just to save my own
I hid my feelings though
You showed me yours
Somehow, some way
Everything just won't go my way
"I fell, I'm fallen, I'm falling
In something I didn't believe in
I thought nightts and days
If I could even try
I gave in, I gave up
The fight between
My head and heart
The roles have changed
Breaking my own heart just for u
The one who's reminding me
Why I've once been so cold"
It just depends of the time
When I'll be broken again
My heart is all crushed
But I keep smiling to U, yeah I do
I can't, and I'll never will
Understand how it goes like this
Everytime when it happens
Both of us acts like nothing happened
Somehow, some way
Everything just won't go my way
CHORUS
Sometimes it makes me
Wanna get lost
Away to the other side
of the Earth
It's starting to hurt
Time to go
My heart screams to stay
When I turned away
As you're wondering
Knowing nothing
What's wrong with me
I could feel how
My heart has already
Flown back to you
Oh, why can't you see
Don't you know you're hurting me
CHORUS
Anything just won't go my way
Go my way…
Why it will not… go my way
CHORUS
Oh, it hurts…
It's starting to hurt

It's always nothing, all your love
Tell me about your overview
And I'll, try to show you how it looks from here
I ain't goin' down
Ain't goin' down
Ain't goin' down no more
I ain't goin' down
Ain't goin' down
Ain't goin' down no more
No, no, no
No!
I can see your true colors
I see red
When you hide all of your lovers under the bed
Instigate a simple life
And who's to say what's black or white?
Just because, you're curious, I've earned another brought me near
Through all the dreams that I could use
Now I know there's nothing I could do
For you!
Ain't goin' down
Ain't goin' down
Ain't goin' down no more
I ain't goin' down
Ain't goin' down
Ain't goin' down no more
No, no, no
I ain't goin' down
Ain't goin' down no more
I ain't goin' down
Ain't goin' down
Ain't goin' down no more
No, no, no
(That'll change, don't worry about it)
I ain't goin' down
Ain't goin' down
Ain't goin' down no more
I ain't goin' down
Ain't goin' down
Ain't goin' down no more
I ain't goin' down
Ooh, ain't goin' down
Ain't goin' down
No, no, no
I think, you should, keep your mouth shut...???
I ain't goin' down
Ain't goin' down
Ain't goin' down no more
I ain't goin' down
Ain't goin' down
Ain't goin' down no more
I ain't goin' down
Ain't goin' down
Ain't goin' down no more
I ain't goin' down
Ain't goin' down
Ain't goin' down no more
Ain't goin' down

Feel like i wanna smack somebody
Turn around and bitch slap somebody (bitch)
But i ain't goin' out bro (no, no, no)
I ain't givin' into it (no, no, no)
Anxieties bash my mind in
Terrorizing my soul like bin laden
But i ain't fallin' down bro (no, no, no)
I won't lose control bro (no, no, no)
Shackle and chained
My soul feels stained
I can't explain got an ich on my brain
Lately my whole aim is to maintain
And regain control of my mainframe
My bloods boiling its beatin' out propaine
My train of thoughts more like a runaway train
I'm in a fast car drivin' in a fast lane
In the rain and i'm might just hydroplaine
I don't fear none of my enemies
And i don't fear bullets from oozies
I've been dealing with something thats worse than these
That'll make you fall to your knees and thats the
The anxiety the sane and the insane rivalry
Paranoias brought me to my knees
Lord please please please
Take away my anxiety
The sane and the insane rivalry
Paranoias brought me to my knees
Lord please please please
Take away my anxiety
My head keeps running away my brother
The only thing making me stay my brother
But i won't give into it bro (no, no, no)
Gotta get myself back now
God, i can't let my mind be
Tell my enemy is my own
Gots to find my inner wealth
Gots to hold up my thoughts
I can't get caught (no, no, no)
I can't give into it now (no, no, no)
Emotions are trapped set on lock
Got my brain stuck goin through the motions
Only i know what's up
I'm filled up with pain
Tryin' to gain my sanity
Everywhere i turn its a dead end infront of me
With nowhere to go gotta shake this anxiety
Got me feelin' strange paranoia took over me
And its weighin' me down
And i can't run any longer, yo
Knees to the ground
I don't fear none of my enemies
And i don't fear bullets from oozies
I've been dealing with something thats worse than these
That'll make you fall to your knees and thats the
The anxiety the sane and the insane rivalry
Paranoias brought me to my knees
Lord please please please
Take away my anxiety
The sane and the insane rivalry
Paranoias brought me to my knees
Lord please please please
Take away my anxiety
I don't fear none of my enemies
And i don't fear bullets from oozies
I've been dealing with something thats worse than these
That'll make you fall to your knees and thats the
The anxiety the sane and the insane rivalry
Paranoias brought me to my knees
Lord please please please
Take away my anxiety

Ohhhhh
Why should I try and judge the things they say
They just won't budge I'm letting go
Ohhhhhhh
And, shelter from the blind, storm
You managed to be kind
But still enough to show me how to keep it together
When I'm crying out in vain
No matter who's to blame
There's still a ways to go
Ooohhh
So if you ask me to believe your heart will follow you
It's got a mind of its own
When it sits wrong and the road gets rough
And you're the one
Whose shoulders just ain't wide enough
Whose shoulders shrug when they've had enough
I'll be the last to say, don't follow your heart
There's more to what it takes to be a man
Than what you know
What you've shown
And that we know you understand
Ohhhh
Another thing, if I were you
I would say all that I do to be half as strong
Or still belong
Ohhhhh
You should take the time to look back at all your misadventures
When it sits wrong and the road gets rough
And you're the one
Whose shoulders just ain't wide enough
Whose shoulders shrug when they've had enough
I'd be the last to say, don't follow your heart
But there's more to what it takes to be a man
Than what you've known
What you've shown
That's what I hope you understand
I never said, don't follow your heart
That's what it takes to be a man
From what you know
All that you've been shown
Even now I hope you understand
I'd be the last to say, don't follow your heart
But there's more to what it takes to be a man
Than what you know
What you've shown
And what we know you understand
I never said, don't follow your heart
That's what it takes to be a man
More than you know
All that you've been shown
Even now I hope you understand

I'm back in the saddle again
I'm back
I'm back in the saddle again
I'm back
Riding' into town alone by the light of the moon
I'm lookin' for old Sukie Jones she crazy horse saloon
Barkeep gimme a drink that's when she caught my eye
She turned to give me a wink that make a grown man cry
I'm back in the saddle again
I'm back
I'm back in the saddle again
I'm back
Come easy, go easy, all right till the rising sun
I'm calling all the shots tonight I'm like a loaded gun
Peelin' off my boots and chaps I'm saddle sore
Four bits gets you time in the racks I scream for more
Fools' gold out of their mines the girls are soaking wet
No tongue's drier than mine I'll come when I get back
I'm back in the saddle again
I'm back
I'm back in the saddle again
I'm back
I'm ridin', I'm loading' up my pistol
I'm ridin', I really got a fistful
I'm ridin', I'm shining' up my saddle
I'm ridin', this snake is gonna rattle
I'm back in the saddle again
I'm back
I'm back in the saddle again
I'm back
Riding' high
Riding' high
Riding' high
Already

Sail away sweet sister
Sail across the sea
Maybe you'll find somebody
That will love you half as much as me
My heart is always with you
No matter what you do
So sail away sweet sister
Cause I'll always be in love with you
But let her be somebody else's queen
I don't want to know about you
Cuz too many others know what I mean
And that's why I got to live without you
I'm in love with a girl
I'm talkin' about
I'm in love with a girl
That I can't live without
I'm in love but it feels like
I'm livin' without
I'm in love but I think I picked a Bad Time
To be in love

The music's too loud,
it just beats, beats, beats,
on my head.
You've got to turn it down,
it just beats, beats, beats.
It's going up and you're going out
Bitch you'd better shut your mouth
or we're gonna burn down your home
You can't stop the music we're lovin',
we'll kick your ass and put your dog in the oven

In my eyes, indisposed
In disguise as no one knows
Hides the face, lies the snake
In the sun in my disgrace
Boiling heat, summer stench
'Neath the black the sky looks dead
Call my name through the cream
And I'll hear you scream again
Black hole sun
Won't you come?
And wash away the rain
Black hole sun
Won't you come?
Won't you come?
Won't you come?
Stuttering, cold and damp
Steal the warm wind tired friend
Times are gone for honest men
And sometimes far too long for snakes
In my shoes, a walking sleep
And my youth I pray to keep
Heaven send hell away
No one sings like you anymore
Black hole sun
Won't you come?
And wash away the rain
Black hole sun
Won't you come?
Won't you come?
Black hole sun
Won't you come?
And wash away the rain
Black hole sun
Won't you come?
Won't you come?
(Black hole sun, black hole sun)
Won't you come
(Black hole sun, black hole sun)
Won't you come
(Black hole sun, black hole sun)
Won't you come
(Black hole sun, black hole sun)
Hang my head, drown my fear
'Till you all just disappear
Black hole sun
Won't you come?
And wash away the rain
Black hole sun
Won't you come?
Won't you come?
Black hole sun
Won't you come?
And wash away the rain
Black hole sun

Mama, just killed a man
Put a gun against his head
Pulled my trigger, now he's dead
Mama, life had just begun
But now I've gone and thrown it all away
Mama, ooo
Didn't mean to make you cry
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow
Carry on, carry on,
As if nothing really matters
Too late, my time has come
Sends shivers down my spine
Body's aching all the time
Goodbye everybody - I've got to go
Gotta leave you all behind
And face the truth
Mama, ooo - I don't want to die
I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all
I see a little silhouetto of a man
Scaramouch, scaramouch will you do the fandango
Thunderbolt and lightning - very very frightening me
Gallileo, Gallileo,
Gallileo, Gallileo,
Gallileo Figaro - magnifico
But I'm just a poor boy and nobody loves me
He's just a poor boy from a poor family
Spare him his life from this monstrosity
Easy come easy go - will you let me go
Bismillah! No - we will not let you go -
Let him go
Bismillah! We will not let you go - let him go
Bismillah! We will not let you go - let me go
Will not let you go - let me go (never)
Never let you go - let me go
Never let me go - ooo
No, no, no, no, no, no, no -
Oh mama mia, mama mia, mama mia let me go
Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me
for me
for me
So you think
You can stone me and spit in my eye
So you think you can love me
And leave me to die
Oh baby - can't do this to me baby
Just gotta get out -
Just gotta get right outta here
Ooh yeah, ooh yeah
Nothing really matters
Anyone can see
Nothing really matters -
Nothing really matters to me
Anyway the wind blows...

Sweet little lady, don't you get crazy
Bring it back home to me
Woman little standing, dreaming to forget him
Bring it back home to me?
Brown-eyed stunner, come on,
Bring it home to me
Kiss a little, fishing for your lover,
Won't you bring it down home to me
See a sky lit on fire, seen the dog it here
She lit her lips, with a passion, in the third degree
See a dirty old lady, with a schoolgirl's grin
Break a back for the daddy all, when she does her things
You can see the love, like check an ounce of pain,
Darling won't you wanna;
Sorry to resent, you said; Gimme back
Keep your teeth
Never wanna hold you,
Never wanna kiss you,
I bet she's taking away from me
Never will repeat it, on never reprimand it,
Will you bring it back home to me
Take care before my baby,
When your baby gives it up for free
She just puts around, being lazy,
But since she brings her love to me
Don't need nothing to save me, say for a piece of your luxury
Like the doorfoot, you'll never gage it
I'll tell you just how it's gonna be
I call your lover in the morning,
When you have your cup of tea
You never give me your warning,
So you better give her right up for me
Guess who's coming over, on your thinks;
That's such a surprise
If you're saying you never know her,
Honey, you better open your eyes
Look out
See a real long fire, she's the dog in here
She lift her lips, with a passion, in the third degree
See a dirty old lady, with a schoolgirl's grin
Break a back for the daddy all, when she does her things
Can't take care before my baby,
When your baby gives it up for free
She just gets around being lazy
Until she brings me her loving to me
I don't need nothing to save me,
Say for a piece of your luxury
Lock the door, but you'll never gage me
I tell you just how it's gonna be
I call your lover in the morning,
When you have your cup of tea
You never give me your warning,
So get yourself a letter from me
Oh, where're you going, tell me;
Who're you to see?
I've been sleeping on your doorstep,
Baby, won't you bring it back ho to me
Get me something for my jealous mind,
You don't get something for free
You just bring it down home to me

Come together
Here come old flat top
He come groovin´up slowly
He got joo joo eyeball
He one holy roller
He got hair down to his knee
Got to be a joker he just do what he please
He wear no shoeshine
He got toe jam football
He got monkey finger
He shoot coca cola
He say i know you, you know me
One thing i can tell you is you got to be free
Come together
Right now
Over me
He bag production
He got walrus gumboot
He got ono sideboard
He one spinal cracker
He got feet down below his knee
Hold you in his armchair you can feel his disease
Come together
Right now
Over me
He roller coaster
He got early warning
He got muddy water
He one mojo filter
He say one and one and one is three
Got to be good lookin´´cause he´s so hard to see
Come together
Right now
Over me

Crash diet of reds'n'ludes
A shot of vitamin C and a bottle of booze
Too stupid to live with nothin' to lose
In your one track mind now
Where's that leave you?
Drink'n'drive white lightning faster baby
Takin' your last ride
Now better be so careful or you'll be dead before you time
Sorry you took mother's car now
Tears in my eyes, baby please don't go
You bet one in too many, Havin' one for the road
fresh from detox, fresh from jail
Took your rehabilitation and you drove me to hell
Drink'n'drive white lightning faster hmm
Takin' your last ride
Better be so careful or you'll be dead before your time
Sorry you took mother's car now
Too soon, for those who didn't mean it
Too late for the pressure and blame
Too bad for those who don't believe it
Ruby street still calls your name
Itchy trigger finger and the race to be alive
Smokin' a cig while you drink'n'drive
With no control in your life ahead
You're never gonna see if you wind up dead
Drink'n'drive white lightning faster
Takin' your last ride
Better be so careful or you'll be dead before your time
Drink'n'drive white lightning baby
It's always on your mind
when you Put your a limit baby, do it one more time
Take it down
Break it down
Somethin's changin', somethin's breakin'
You gotta be abroad outta your family
baby one more time to make it
Sweet history, Ooohhhh
If you don't care about yourself
Would you please take me alive
Oooohhhh...
You gonna
You gonna drink'n'drive

Have ya seen her so
Movin with a style and ease
And i feel her from across the room
Yes its love in the third degree.
Ooh baby, baby
Won't you turn your head my way.
Ooh baby, baby cmon
Take a chance,
Your old enough to dance
Dance the night away
Like wine barely a beginner,
But just watch that lady go.
She's so fine
Cause dancin gets her higher than
Anything else she knows.
Ooh baby, baby
Won't you turn your head my way,
Ohh baby, baby
Well don't skip romance now
That ya old enough to dance
Dance the night away
Ooh yeah
Dance the night away
Dance, dance, dance

If we could see tomorrow
What of your plans
No one can live in sorrow
Ask all your friends
Times that you took in stride they're
Back in demand
I was the one who's washing
Blood off your hands
Don't you cry tonight
I still love you baby
Don't you cry tonight
Don't you cry tonight
There's a heaven above you baby
And don't you cry tonight
I know the things you wanted
They're not what you have
With all the people talkin'
It's drivin' you mad
If I was standin' by you
How would you feel
Knowing your love's decided
And all love is real, baby
And don't you cry tonight
Don't you cry tonight
Don't you cry tonight
There's a heaven above you baby
And don't you cry tonight
I thought I could live in your world
As years all went by
With all the voices
I've heard
Something has died
And when you're in need of someone
My heart won't deny you
So many seem so lonely
With no one left to cry to baby
And don't you cry tonight
And don't you cry tonight
And don't you cry tonight
There's a heaven above you baby
And don't you cry
Don't you ever cry
Don't you cry
Don't you cry tonight
Baby maybe someday
Don't you cry
Don't you ever cry
Don't you cry
Don't you cry tonight

Old man lying by the side of the road
With the lorries rolling by
Blue moon sinking from the weight of the load
And the building scrape the sky
Cold wind ripping down the allay at dawn
And the morning paper flies
Dead man lying by the side of the road
With the daylight in his eyes
Don't let it bring you down
It's only castles burning
Find someone who's turning
And you will come around
Blind man running through the light of the night
With an answer in his hand
Come on down to the river of sight
And you can really understand
Red lights flashing through the window in the rain
Can you hear the sirens moan?
White cane lying in a gutter in the lane
If you're walking home alone
Don't let it bring you down
It's only castles burning
Just find someone who's turning
And you will come around
Don't let it bring you down
It's only castles burning
Just find someone who's turning
And you will come around

Talk to me softly
There is something in your eyes
Don't hang your head in sorrow
And please don't cry
I know how you feel inside I've
I've been there before
Something is changin inside you

Don't you cry tonight

Day after day I'm more confused
So I look for the light in the pouring rain
You know that's a game that I hate to lose
I'm feelin' the strain, ain't it a shame
Oh, give me the beat, boys, and free my soul
I wanna get lost in your rock and roll and drift away
Oh, give me the beat, boys, and free my soul
I wanna get lost in your rock and roll and drift away
Beginning to think that I'm wastin' time
I don't understand the things I do
The world outside looks so unkind
I'm countin' on you to carry me through
And when my mind is free
You know a melody can move me
And when I'm feelin' blue
The guitar's comin' through to soothe me
Thanks for the joy that you've given me
I want you to know I believe in your song
Rhythm and rhyme and harmony
You help me along makin' me strong

She's a good girl, loves her mamma,
Loves Jesus, and America too.
She's a good girl, crazy 'bout Elvis
Loves horses, and her boyfriend too.
And it's a long day, livin' in Reseda
There's a freeway, runnin' thru the yard
And i'm a bad boy
'Cause i don't even miss her
I'm a bad boy, for breaking
And i'm free, free falling.
Yeah i'm free, free falling.
And all the vampires walkin' through the valley
Move west down Ventura Boulevard.
And all the bad boys
Are standin' in the shadows
And the good girls
Are home with broken hearts.
And i'm free, free falling.
Yeah i'm free, free falling.
I wanna glide down over Mulholland
I wanna write her name in the sky.
I'm gonna free fall out into nothin'
Gonna leave this world for a while.

I've known my share of pain
It's a crown of thorns
That never seems to break the skin
There's no blood in the scars
Just your broken heart
You used to be so sweet
You walked with a smile
Life tastes funny and the coffee's cold
Amuse yourself, make you useful
You've got nothing good to say
Keep your mouth shut
Nothing good to do
Keep it to yourself
Nothing's ever good enough for you
Sick of everything that you say
It's going down
Sorry for everything
Sick of everything that you do
It's going down
You look like a fool
You never mean to hurt no one
They just happen to be there next to you
'Cause you're going down
I know this dark place
I heard these words
On the tip of a million tongues
I've heard them yelled
I've even heard them sung
Get into your car and drive
Just as fast as you can
You've had your 15 minutes
You tried to take an hour but
Now no one, hears your call
You've got nothing good to say
Keep your mouth shut
Nothing good to do
Keep it to yourself
Nothing's ever good enough for you
Sick of everything that you say
It's going down
Sorry for everything
Sick of everything that you do
It's going down
You look like a fool
You never mean to hurt no one
They just happen to be there next to you
'Cause you're going down
'Cause you're going down
'Cause you're going down
'Cause you're going down
'Cause you're going down
You're going down
You're going down
'Cause you're going down
You're going down

All cautions made
Every chance was given
No effort spared
To save what we had
All in good faith
I would not hesitate
To extend myself
And lend you a hand
But you had to play it cool, had to do it your way
Had to be a fool, had to throw it all away
Too hard school
And you thought you were here to stay
If that were true, it wouldn't matter anyway
As tempers fade
And lies forgiven
No God's embrace
Could break what we had
And in it's place
A storm had lifted
I would've thought you could've been more of a man
But you had to play it cool, had to do it your way
Had to be a fool, had to throw it all away
Too hard school
And you thought you were here to stay
If that were true, it wouldn't matter anyway
Too hard school
And you thought you were here to stay
If that were true, it wouldn't matter anyway

Well, since my baby left me,
I found a new place to dwell.
It's down at the end of lonely street
At heartbreak hotel.
You make me so lonely baby,
I get so lonely,
I get so lonely i could die.
And although it's always crowded,
You still can find some room.
Where broken hearted lovers
Do cry away their gloom.
You make me so lonely baby,
I get so lonely,
I get so lonely i could die.
Well, the bell hop's tears keep flowin',
And the desk clerk's dressed in black.
Well they been so long on lonely street
They ain't ever gonna look back.
You make me so lonely baby,
I get so lonely,
I get so lonely i could die.
Hey now, if your baby leaves you,
And you got a tale to tell.
Just take a walk down lonely street
To heartbreak hotel.
And don't make me cry

Living easy, livin' free
Season ticket, on a one way ride
Asking nothing, leave me be
Taking everything in my stride
Don't need reason, don't need rhyme
Ain't nothin' that I’d rather do
Going down, party time
My friends are gonna be there too
I'm on the highway to hell
On the highway to hell
Highway to hell
I'm on the highway to hell
No stop signs, speed limit
Nobody's gonna slow me down
Like a wheel, gonna spin it
Nobody's gonna mess me 'round
Hey, satan!
Paid my dues
Playin' in a rockin' band
Hey mama! Look at me
I'm on my way to the promised land
I'm on the highway to hell

I met a gin-soaked, bar-room queen in Memphis
She tried to take me upstairs for a ride
She had to heave me right across shoulder
'Cause I just can't seem to drink you off my mind
It's the honky tonk women
Gimme, gimme, gimme the honky tonk blues
I laid a divorcée in New York City
I had to put up some kind of a fight
The lady then she covered me with roses
But I just can't seem to drink you off my mind
It's the honky tonk women
Gimme, gimme, gimme the honky tonk blues

And you're gonna have to catch me if you wanna wash it out

with my juvenile skills and delinquent games
'Cuz I'm a fast motherfucker
let me tell you 'bout it sucker
If you fuck with me, I'll fuck your mother
Your sister too, and your best girlfriend
I'll line 'em up, and put 'em end to end
And then I'll put out, stick it in, I'll pull it out
I'll grab your face and cum in your mouth
It tastes good, don't it?
It tastes good, and you know it
It tastes good, don't it?

If you're looking for a fight go have some fun

I'm livin' every moment
Like its my last
You could say I push too hard
But I like it fast
There ain't nothing
On what you can depend
What you call your highway
Could be your dead-end
Luck ain't got the time
To be your friend or mine
I'm doin' nothing
I'm killing time
Don't get me wrong
Don't wanna bring you down
Take or give it as it comes
Don't waste your life now hangin' around
Sometimes when you're on your own
You look around and find yourself all alone
Luck ain't got the time
To be your friend or mine
I make my living
Killing time
Running late killing time
We're doing over, overtime
Spend your life on borrowed dime
I make my living killing time
Say you're depressed
You've been resist
Shake it, now don't you fake it
You're the one who wants to make it
Don't fake on anything
Cuz it's in your hands
Stand up every time you fall
You gotta show the world you're feelin' down
Luck ain't got the time
To be your friend or mine
I make my living
Killing time
Running late killing time
We're doing over, overtime
Spend your life on borrowed dime
I make my living killing time
I'm killing time

Bought me a box of french cigars
Bought me a black beret
Get my french from a girl next door
Teaching me night and day
Got me thinking 'bout the south of France
Vis-a-vis vous
Pack my suitcase, take a chance
Got nothing to lose
Gimme the sound of the rolling dice
Gimme a whiskey, don't think twice
Deal me the card that takes my blues away
Take me away to Marseilles
Fast train, jet plane, money to burn
Don't ask no reasons why
Drinkin' champagne, playin' cool
Don't even have to try
Gimme the sound of the rolling dice
Gimme a whiskey, don't think twice
Deal me the card that takes my blues away
Take me away to Marseilles

But what's your motivation
Ain't the wine ain't the creeps

Tell me what's your motivation
Yeah you said you knew me when I was easier to be around
Knew me like we were really friends
You let me wear your hat
When all I really wanted was to know why you wake up
Tell me where you hide your make-up

Say that's a war that you can't win
But I have had enough of them
And who can blame me
Sands of time and desert winds
Nomads and barbarians
I won't bend my will to them
You aggravate me
Oh, my salvation
N' all my frustration
Caught in the lies
No one had wove as well
Somewhere in time
Where only I could tell
Oh, sweet salvation
Like all my frustration
Caught up in lies
No one had wove as well
Somewhere in time
Where only I could tell
Ooh
Oh, sweet salvation
And all my frustration
Caught up in lies
If you had wove so well
Somewhere in time
Then only I could tell
Ohh!

Riad N' The Bedouins

Turn it up
Make it loud
Get your guitar ready to scream
Heavy drums; Amplifiers
We're a sonic demolition team
You gotta rock the rock
Pound it all around
Rock the rock
With a stone crunching sound
Ooh, rock the rock
Hammer and grind
Rock the rock
It's gravel makin' time
Get in the ring, we'll give you a brawl
We're employed to destroy
We're a rock 'n' roll wrecking ball
You gotta rock the rock
Smash it to bits
Rock the rock
With a heavy metal fist

Sail away sweet sister
Sail across the sea
Maybe you'll find somebody
That love happens as much as me
My heart is always with you
No matter what you do
So sail away sweet sister
'cause I'll always be in love with you
But if you love somebody else, sweetheart
I do not want know about of you
'cause you see many others, you know what I mean
That's why I gotta live without you
I'm in love with a girl, I'm talking about
I'm in love with a girl that I cant live without
I'm in love, but it seems that
I'm livin' without
I'm in love, but the worst season to be
Is that one to be in love

I am sailing, I am sailing
Home again across the sea.
I am sailing, stormy waters
To be near you, to be free.
I am flying, I am flying,
Like a bird across the sky
I am flying, passing high clouds
To be with you, to be free.
Can you hear me? Can you hear me?
Through the dark night, far away
I am dying, forever crying
To be with you, who can say?
Can you hear me? Can you hear me?
Through the dark night, far away.
I am dying, forever dying,
To be with you, who can say?
We are sailing, we are sailing,
Home again across the sea.
We are sailing stormy waters,
To be near you, to be free.
Oh Lord, to be near you, to be free.
Oh Lord, to be near you, to be free.

Lets drink to the hard working people,
Lets drink to the lowly of birth.
Raise your glass to the good and the evil,
Lets drink to the salt of the earth.
Say a prayer for the common foot soldier,
Spare a thought for his back breaking work.
Say a prayer for his wife and his children,
Who burn the fires and who still till the earth.
And when I search a faceless crowd,
A swirling mass of gray and black and white.
They don't look real to me,
In fact, they look so strange.
Raise your glass to the hard working people,
Lets drink to the uncounted heads.
Lets think of the wandering millions,
Who need leaders but get gamblers instead.
Spare a thought for the stay at home voter,
His empty eyes gaze at strange beauty shows.
And a parade of the gray suited grafters,
A choice of cancer or polio.
And when I search a faceless crowd,
A swirling mass of gray and black and white.
They don't look real to me,
In fact, they look so strange.
Lets drink to the hard working people,
Lets think of the lowly of birth.
Spare a thought for the rag taggy people,
Sets drink to the salt of the earth.
Lets drink to the hard working people,
Lets drink to the salt of the earth.
Lets think of the two thousand million,
Lets think of the humble of birth.
Lets drink to the hard working people,
Lets drink to the lowly of birth.
Raise your glass to the good and the evil,
Lets drink to the salt of the earth.
Say a prayer for the common foot soldier,
Spare a thought for his back breaking work.
Say a prayer for his wife and his children,
Who burn the fires and who still till the earth.

Don't you try to stop us now
I just refuse
Don't you try to stop us now
Cause I just won't let you
Sometimes I feel like
The world is on top of me
Breakin' me down with
An endless monotony
Sometimes I feel like
There's nothing that's stopping me
All things are possible
I am unstoppable
Some may convince you
No one can break through
I'm here to tell you
You're worth
More than they tell you
Don't you try to stop us now
I just refuse
Don't you try to stop us now
Cause I just won't let you
Sometimes I feel like
My life's a catastrophe
Can't understand why
It seem's like it has to be
Sometimes I feel like
It's all opened up for me
Nothing's impossible
I am inconquerable
No one can make you
Do what they want to
You know you're stronger
Than the lies
That they tell you
Don't you try to stop us now
(I'd give anything to know)
I just refuse
Don't you try to stop us now
(I would have never made it so far)
Cause I just won't let you
Believe in yourself
Some may convince you
No one can break through
You know you're stronger
Than the lies
That they tell you
Don't you try to stop us now
(I'd give anything to know)
I just refuse

Don't you try to stop us now

Listen motherfuckers to this song that should be heard
Thrown down in the gutter, it's more than you deserve
Kneeling fucking virgin, you know that's what you are
Pussy for a maggot, isn't that a shock
What can I do with a bitch like you?
You know that it's true
All I have ask of you
I'll be dammed
If it's not true
A bitch like you
Get your head down in the sky
Fucking little schemer got yourself a broken heart
Syphilitic preachers baby I know who you are
Parasitis demons sucking acid through your heart

I am a man cold and ugly,
Within me take a terrible hatred
Have killed thousands of people without knowing that
Looks like i'm immortal
That never came close to death
Matador i'ma murderer, baby
Do not try to approach me because i
I can also kill you, murderer!
I'm a murderer!
I am a killer white skin
Ingenues like scary people
I am very sinister and there
Nothing i can do now
In my blood i can not stop,
But after a few hours i started
Reflect on my actions and that was when i realized
He did not like me to be forgiven
Killer killer am
I did not want that shit!
Now i am left alone to die
Also

Hey, hey, hey!
When you look you see right through me
Cut the rope, fell to my knees
Fallen, broken every single time
Always keep me under finger

But I see sometime pleasure in my mind
Yeah, here comes the water
It's come to wash away the sins of you and I
This time, you see!
Hey, hey, hey!
When you seek me you destroy me
Rip my mind and smell the poppy's
Fallen blood in every single time
Always keep me under finger
That's the spot where you might linger
But I see sometime the pleasure in my mind
Yeah, here comes the water
It's come to wash away the sins of you and I
This time, you see
Like holy water
It only burns you faster than you'll ever dry
This time, with me!

We're getting older.
You know that it's true.
Lose the pain.
I know you got to.
I know you do.
Go a phone call.
It went like this,,,
"You wanna be in the band?"
"I want to."
"You wanna star in the show?"
"You know that I want to."
I gotta let you know. Oh no.
Come on steve, dust of those drums.
I got shot with you velvet revolver.
It broke me in two.
I'm not dead.
I've got some life left.
Don't bury me too soon.
"Remember getting to high?"
"I want to."
Remember getting to low?"
"Don't you know that I want to."
I couldn't let you go. Oh no.

What can I say
Free will is blind today
The choice that you made
Is not a road that I would take
To use and betray
Simple as the power play
Not far away
With tears that go unexplained now
Oh, my love, can it be?
I’m falling from your grace with me now
Oh, more than ever
I still remember
They’re saying
It’s just a passing phase
No more like a game
Problems of the human race
Goes right to your brain
Caught down in a hidden place
With no sense of shame
The secrets are there and you can’t
Oh, my love, can it be?
I’m falling from your grace with me
Now more than ever
I still remember your name
When do you think you can tell me?
How long do you think I can wait? Oh no I said
I thought I never said I was sorry
Now dont you fall on your face now with livin with it
The storm is comin ‘again
I sense the shiverin’ down
You thought you had it, ah
But thought you had it figured it out
But you do not even care
How could it be?
You’re fallingin ‘from your grace with me
And now, my love
I ask
I ask myself what I believe in
‘Cause now
More than ever
I still remember
Your name

A day that broke up your mind
Destroyed your notion of circular time
It's just that demon life has got you in its sway

Ain't flinging tears out on the dusty ground
For all my friends out on the burial ground

There must be ways to find out
Love is the way they say is really strutting out

Right in the bed next to mine

Sail away, sweet sister
Sail across the sea
Maybe you find somebody
That love happens
As much as me
My heart is always with you
No matter what you do
So sail away, sweet sister cause
I always will be in love with you
But if you love somebody else
Sweetheart
I don't wanna know about you
Sweetheart
Sweetheart
Cause you see so many others
You know what I mean and
That is why I got to live without you
I'm in love with the girl

I've looked under chairs
I've looked under tables
I've tried to find the key
To fifty million fables
They call me The Seeker
I've been searching low and high
I won't get to get what I'm after
Till the day I die
I asked Bobby Dylan
I asked The Beatles
I asked Timothy Leary
But he couldn't help me either
They call me The Seeker
I've been searching low and high
I won't get to get what I'm after
Till the day I die
People tend to hate me
'Cause I never smile
As I ransack their homes
They wanna shake my hand
Focusing on nowhere
Investigating miles
I'm a seeker
I'm a really desperate man
I won't get to get what I'm after
Till the day I die
I learned how to raise my voice in anger
Yeah, but look at my face, ain't this a smile?
I'm happy when life's good and when it's bad I cry
I've got values but I don't know how or why
I'm looking for me
You're looking for you
We're looking in at each other
And we don't know what to do

I was caught

And I knew
There was no help, no help from you (thunder)
Sound of the drums
Beatin' in my heart
The thunder of guns
Tore me apart
You've been thunderstruck
Went down the highway
Broke the limit, we hit the town
Went through to Texas, yeah, Texas
And we had some fun
We met some girls
Some dancers who gave a good time
Broke all the rules, played all the fools
Yeah, yeah, they, they, they blew our minds
I was shakin' at the knees
Could I come again, please?
Yeah, the ladies were too kind
You've been thunderstruck, thunderstruck
Yeah, yeah, yeah, thunderstruck

Words and music by brian may
Get your party gown and get your pigtail down
And get your heart beatin' baby
Got my timin' right I got my act all tight
It's gotta be tonight
My little school babe
Your momma says you don't
And your daddy says you won't

Ain't no way I'm gonna lose out this time
Tie your mother down
Tie your mother down
Lock your daddy out of doors

Tie your mother down
Tie your mother down
Give me all your love tonight
You're such a dirty louse go get outa my house
That's all I ever get from your family ties
In fact I don't think I ever heard
A single little civil word from those guys
I don't give a light
I'm gonna make out all right
I've got a sweetheart hand
To put a stop to all that
Snipin' and grousin'
Tie your mother down
Tie your mother down
Take your little brother swimmin'
With a brick that's all right
Tie your mother down
Tie your mother down
Or you ain't no friend of mine
Your momma and your daddy
Gonna plague me till I die

'Cause I'm a peace lovin' guy
Tie your mother down

Give me all your love tonight
All your love tonight

"Hey this bottle's empty, you got 2 bucks?
C'mon, we'll buy a bottle
Alright, I'm headin' to the store and I'm gonna buy smokes
Hot damn"
Every night, I go out and get in my car, oh yeah
I push on the pedal but you know I go too far
There're parties everywhere that I can see
Usin' myself will be the death of me
Ya see every night I get a call on the telephone
My sweet little baby beggin' me just to come home
But I know that everyday I gotta have me some fun
With Suzy to the left and Sally to my right
I know that I need just more than one
Chorus
Said it's too much too fast
I don't care if I won't last
Said it's too much too soon
I don't care, get outta my room
Said it's too much too fast
I don't care if I won't last
Said it's too much too soon
I don't care, get outta my room
Let's go
When the night goes on and I seem to see some friends
Not a buck for the car for the gas goes so fast?
With friends like that tell me who's gonna last
Well the city's hot but tonight I'm not
I want everything that everybody's got
Not a badge in the pan or a legend hand
Just give me one more, one last dance
Said it's too much too fast
I don't care if I won't last
Said it's too much too soon
I don't care, get outta my room
Said it's too much too fast
I don't care if I won't last
Said it's too much too soon
I don't care, get outta my room
Let's go
Take the car, take the keys
Said my money don't grow on trees
You make me stumble and fall
T'ill I'm bloody at my knees?
I climbed back up to find that all my money's gone
Too much too soon not know since it's been so long?
You can drive me to the edge but I really don't mind
Ya see when I'm in my car I leave you behind
There's another girl that's waitin' down the road
When I'm out the door you know that's just where I'll go
Said it's too much too fast
I don't care if I won't last
Said it's too much too soon
I don't care, get outta my room
Said it's too much too fast
I don't care if I won't last
Said it's too much too soon
I don't care, get outta my room
Said it's too much too fast
I don't care if I won't last

Well, on a train, I met a dame,
She rather handsome, but (???) the same
She was pretty, from New York City
I'm walkin' down that old fair lane,
I'm in heat, I'm in love,
But I just couldn't tell her so
I said, train kept a-rollin' all night long

With a "heave!", and a "ho!"

On the road for forty days,
Last night in Little Rock put me in a haze.
Sweet, sweet Connie -- doin' her act,
She had the whole show and that's a natural fact.
Up all night with Freddy King,
I got to tell you poker's his thing.
A-booze 'n ladies keep me right,
As long as we can make it to the show tonight.
CHORUS
We're an American band.
We're an American band.
We're coming to your town, we'll help you party it down.
We're an American band.
Four young chaquitas in Omaha,
Was waitin' for the band to return from the show.
Feelin' good, feelin' right, it's Saturday night,
The hotel detective -- he was out-a-sight.
Now, these fine ladies, they had a plan,
They was out to meet the boys in the band.
They said, "Come on, dudes, let's get it on,"
And we proceeded to tear that hotel down.

May your days be merry and bright and may all your Christmases be white

Wanna tell you a story
'Bout a woman I know
When it comes to lovin'
Oh she steals the show
She ain't exactly pretty
Ain't exactly small
Forty-two, thirty-nine, fifty-six
You could say she's got it all
Never had a woman
Never had a woman like you
Doing all the things
Doing all the things you do
Ain't no fairy story
Ain't no skin and bone
But you give it all you got
Weighing in at nineteen stone
CHORUS:
You're a whole lotta woman
A whole lotta woman
Whole lotta Rosie
And you're a whole lotta woman
Oh honey you can do it
Do it to me all night long
Only one to turn
Only one to turn me on
All through the night time
And right around the clock
To my surprise
Rosie never stops

And if it snows that stretch down south
Won't ever stand the strain

She was a fast machine she kept her motor clean
She was the best damn woman that I ever seen
She had the sightless eyes telling me no lies
Knocking me out with those American thighs
Taking more than her share
Had me fighting for air
She told me to come, but I was already there
'Cause the walls start shaking
The earth was quaking
My mind was aching
And we were making it
And you shook me all night long
Yeah, you shook me all night long
Working double time on the seduction line
She's one of a kind, she's just mine, all mine
Wanted no applause it's just another course
Made a meal outta me
And come back for more
Had to cool me down to take another round
Now I'm back in the ring to take another swing
'Cause the walls were shaking the earth was quaking
My mind was aching
And we were making it
And you shook me all night long
Yeah, you shook me all night long
It knocked me out I said you
Shook me all night long
You had me shaking and you
Shook me all night long
Yeah, you shook me
When you took me
You really took me and you
Shook me all night long
Ah, you shook me all night long
Yeah, yeah, you shook me all night long
You really got me and you
Shook me all night long
Yeah, you shook me
Yeah, you shook me

I
I can't promise you that I won't let you down
And I
I can't promise you that I will be the only one around
When your hope falls down
But we're young
Open flowers in the windy fields of this war-torn world
And love
This city breathes the plague of loving things more than their creators
I ran away
I could not take the burden of both me and you
It was too fast
Casting love on me as if it were a spell I could not break
When it was a promise I could not make
But what if I was wrong?
But hold on to what you believe in the light
When the darkness has robbed you of all your sight
And now this land
Means less and less to me without you breathing through its trees
At every turn
The water runs away from me and the halo disappears
And the hole when you're not near
So what if I was wrong?
But hold on to what you believe in the light
When the darkness has robbed you of all your sight
So hold on to what you believed in the light

I turned up with my cap on back to front
Trying to be someone I saw on tv once
You were sitting by the window looking out for me
We were trying to find a way to say hi
That didn't seem strange but it didn't work out
Maybe that was just the way that it felt to me
It's taken me so long
Maybe I'm just too shy to say it
We could be more than friends
But maybe I'm just too shy
Walking home down the uxbridge road
Headphones on I got a cigarette rolled
I know I shouldn't light it cause
I haven't smoked one for weeks
Conversations running through my head
Till I get stuck on one thing
You should not have said but you said
And now it's all that I can thing about
It's taken me so long
Maybe I'm just too shy to say it
We could be more than friends
But maybe I'm just too shy
Let's go find a corner we can sit it
And talk about that film instead of us
Even though throughout it I was thinking
I was gonna say I love you afterwards
It's taken me so long
Maybe I'm just too shy to say it
We could be more than friends
But maybe I'm just too shy

Where do I turn to
When there's no choice to make?
And how do I presume
When there's so much at stake?
I was so sure of it all
But what if I need you
In my darkest hour?
And what if it turns out
There is no other?
If this is
Our last hope
We would see a sign, oh
We would see a sign
Well, I've been running
From the ashes we left
Forgiveness begs for itself
But how can I forget?
Well, there's a stain on it all?
But what if I need you

And what if it turns out
There is no other?

If this is
Our time now

So give us a sign
I need some guiding light

Amazing Grace, how sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me
I once was lost but now am found
Was blind, but now I see
T'was Grace that taught my heart to fear
And Grace, my fears relieved
How precious did that Grace appear
The hour I first believed
Through many dangers, toils and snares
I have already come
'Tis Grace that brought me safe thus far
And Grace will lead me home
When we've been here ten thousand years
Bright shining as the Sun
We've no less days to sing God's praise
Than when we've first begun
Amazing Grace, how sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me
I once was lost but now am found
Was blind, but now I see

Well, they blew up the chickenman in philly last night, now they blew up his house too
Down on the boardwalk they're gettin' ready for a fight, gonna see what them racket boys can do
Now there's trouble busin' in from outta state and the d.a., can't get no relief
Gonna be a rumble out on the promenade and the gamblin' commissions hangin' on by the skin of its teeth
Everything dies, baby, that's a fact
But maybe everything that dies someday comes back...
Put your makeup on fix your hair up pretty and meet me tonight in atlantic city
Well i got a job and tried to put my money away
But i got in too deep and i could not pay
So i drew what i had from the central trust
And i bought us two tickets on that coast city bus
Everything dies, baby, that's a fact
But maybe everything that dies someday comes back...
Put your makeup on fix your hair up pretty and meet me tonight in atlantic city
Now our luck may have died and our love may be cold but with you forever i'll stay
We're goin' out where the sands turnin' to gold, so put on your stockin's cause the night is gettin' cold
And maybe everything dies, that's a fact
But maybe everything that dies someday comes back...
Now i been lookin' for a job but it's hard to find
Down here it's just winners and losers and don't get caught on the wrong side of that line
Well i'm tired of comin' out on the losin' end
So honey last night i met this guy and i'm gonna do a little favor for him
Well, i guess everything dies, baby, that's a fact
But maybe everything that dies someday comes back...
Put your makeup on, fix your hair up pretty and meet me tonight in atlantic city

How fickle my heart and how woozy my eyes
I struggle to find any truth in your lies
And now my heart stumbles on things I don't know
My weakness I feel I must finally show
Lend me your hand and we'll conquer them all
But lend me your heart and I'll just let you fall
Lend me your eyes I can change what you see
But your soul you must keep totally free
Heart, heart
In these bodies we will live
In these bodies we will die
Where you invest your love
You invest your life
In these bodies we will live
In these bodies we will die
Where you invest your love
You invest your life
Awake my soul
Awake my soul
Awake my soul
You were made to meet your maker
Awake my soul
Awake my soul
Awake my soul
You were made to meet your maker
You were made to meet your maker

Sit
Enthroned in white grandeur
But tired
And shift
A wisp of wayward silver hair
From your eyes
I'd never seen you unkempt before
As you whispered: Darling, close the door
Well, how
Have I not made a note of every word
You ever said?
And time
Is not on our side
But I'll pretend that it's alright
She says the Lord has a plan
But admits it's pretty hard to understand
Before you leave
You must know you are beloved
And before you leave
Remember I was with you
Are you afraid?
How ever could you not be?
In this rosy light
This is strange
I feel a hand come through the mirror
Pointing at the light
Point at the light we never see
As you put your feathered arms over me
Before you leave
You must know you are beloved
And before you leave
Remember I was with you
And as you leave
I won't hold you back, beloved
We'll sit
And talk the stars down from the sky
And I'll not
Forget the chaos in your eyes, love
And as you leave
You must know you are beloved
And as you leave
I can see the wild has come for you
And as you leave
I won't hold you back, beloved
And as you leave
See my children playing at your feet

Older brother, restless soul, lie down
Lie for a while with your ear against the earth
And you'll hear your sister sleep talking
Say: Your hair is long but not long enough to reach
Home to me
But your beard
Someday might be
And she'll wake up in a cold sweat on the floor
Next to a family portrait drawn when you were four
And beside a jar of two cent coins that are no good no more
She'll lay it aside
Older father, weary soul, you'll drive
Out to the home you made on the mountainside
With that ugly, terrible thing
Those papers for divorce
And a lonely ring
A lonely ring
Sit on your porch
And pluck your strings
And you'll find somebody you can blame
And you'll follow the creek that runs out into the sea
And you'll find the peace of the Lord
Grandfather, weary soul, you'll fly
Over your life once more before you die
Since our grandma passed away
You've waited for forever and a day
Just to die
And someday soon
You will die
It was the only woman you ever loved
That got burnt by the sun too often when she was young
And the cancer spread and it ran into her body and her blood
And there's nothing you can do about it now

Some days, things just take way too much of my energy
I look up and the whole room's spinning
You take my cares away
I can so overcomplicate, people tell me to medicate
Feel my blood runnin', swear the sky's fallin'
How do I know if this is fabricated?
Time goes by, and I can't control my mind
Don't know what else to try, but you tell me every time
Just keep breathin' and breathin' and breathin' and breathin'
And oh, I gotta keep, keep on breathin'
Just keep breathin' and breathin' and breathin' and breathin'
And oh, I gotta keep, keep on breathin'
Sometimes it's hard to find, find my way up into the clouds
Tune it out, they can be so loud
You remind me of a time when things weren't so complicated
All I need is to see your face
Feel my blood runnin', swear the sky's fallin'
How do I know if this is fabricated?
Time goes by and I can't control my mind
Don't know what else to try, but you tell me every time
Just keep breathin' and breathin' and breathin' and breathin'

As the winter winds litter london with lonely hearts
Oh the warmth in your eyes swept me into your arms
Was it love or fear of the cold that led us through the night?
Over every kiss your beauty trumped my doubt
And my head told my heart
"let love grow"
But my heart told my head
"this time no
This time no"
We'll be washed and buried one day my girl
And the time we were given will be left for the world
The flesh that lived and loved will be eaten by plague
So let the memories be good for those who stay
And my head told my heart
"let love grow"
But my heart told my head
"this time no"
Yes, my heart told my head
"this time no
This time no"
Oh the shame that sent me off from the guard that i once loved
Was the same that sent me into your arms
Oh and pestilence is won when you are lost and i am gone
And no hope, no hope will overcome
And my head told my heart
"let love grow"
And my heart told my head
"this time no"
Yes, my heart told my head
"this time no
This time no"
And if your strife strikes at your sleep
Remember spring swaps snow for leaves
You'll be happy and wholesome again
When the city clears and sun ascends
And my head told my heart
"let love grow"
But my heart told my head
"this time no"
And my head told my heart
"let love grow"
But my heart told my head
"this time no
This time no"

Come, Thou Fount of every blessing,
Tune my heart to sing Thy grace;
Streams of mercy, never ceasing,
Call for songs of loudest praise.
Teach me some melodious sonnet,
Sung by flaming tongues above.
Praise the mount, I'm fixed upon it,
Mount of Thy unchanging love.
Here I raise my Ebenezer;
Here there by Thy great help I've come;
And I hope, by Thy good pleasure,
Safely to arrive at home.
Jesus sought me when a stranger,
Wandering from the fold of God;
He, to rescue me from danger,
Interposed His precious blood.
O to grace how great a debtor
Daily I'm constrained to be
Let that grace now, like a fetter,
Bind my wandering heart to Thee.
Prone to wander, Lord, I feel it,
Prone to leave the God I love;
Here's my heart, O take and seal it,
Seal it for Thy courts above.
Come, Thou Fount of every blessing,
Tune my heart to sing Thy grace;
Streams of mercy, never ceasing,
Call for songs of loudest praise.
Teach me some melodious sonnet,
Sung by flaming tongues above.
Praise the mount, I'm fixed upon it,
Mount of Thy unchanging love.

You found a sweater on the ocean floor
They're gonna find it if you didnt close the door.
You and this model sit outside the side-
In a house on a street they wouldnt park on the night.
Dad was a risk taker.
His was a shoe maker.
You greatest hits 2006,
Little listmaker.
Caught in the melody,
You wait in the car.
You were born with ten fingers
And you're gonna use them all.
Interest in colors I discovered myself
If your art life is gritty
You'll be toasting my health
If an interest in coats,
You should be lining the walls.
When your birth right is interest
You could just screw it all.
Me and my cousins
And you and your cousins
Its a line that is always running.
Me and my cousins,
You and your cousins,
I can feel it coming
You can turn your back on the biddlewood (4x)
Me and my cousins and you and your cousins
Its a line thats always running
Me and my cousins and you and your cousins
I can feel it coming
Me and my cousins and you and your cousins
Its a line thats always running
Me and my cousins and you and your cousins
I can feel it coming

There to dwell in adamantine chains and penal fire
Who durst defy the Omnipotent to arms
Nine times the space that measures day and night
Rolling in the fiery gulf, confounded though immortal
But his doom reserved him to more wrath
For now the thought
Both of lost happiness and lasting pain, torments him
Round he throws his baleful eyes
That witnessed huge affliction and dismay
Mixed with obdurate pride and steadfast hate
At once, as far as Angels ken, he views
The dismal situation, waste and wild
A dungeon horrible, on all sides round
Regions of sorrow
Doleful shades, where peace and rest can never dwell
Hope never comes, that comes to all
But torture without end still urges
As one great furnace flamed
Yet from those flames no light
But rather darkness visible

Do not lie to us
Don't hide your eyes from us
I will take this offered cup
I will sit upon your floor
Tell your stories, tell of your pain
That's what I came here for
And your children come and go as you weep
But what have I?
If I have not love, I am a waste
My words are empty vessels
If I do nothing in this place
And we can scream into the shadows
And it's good that we can
But walk with me, I think we'll find a way
And walk with me, I think we'll find a way
But I'll meet you at the delta
Where the rivers run into the sea
And I'll meet you at the delta
What's behind, I can clearly see
But that beyond, that's beyond me
When it feels like nothing else matters
Will you put your arms around me?
When it feels like nothing else matters
Will you put your arms around me?
Does your love prefer the other?
Or does your love just makes you feel good?
Does my love prefer the other?
Or does my love just make me feel good?
When it's all just dust to dust
And that's how it will be
When it's all just nothingness
That means nothing to me
When it's all just dust to dust
And how it will be
When it's all just nothingness
That means nothing to me
Does my love prefer the other?
Or does my love just make me feel good?
Does my love prefer the other?
Or does my love just make me feel good?
When it feels like nothing else matters
Will you put your arms around me?
When it feels like nothing else matters
Will you put your arms around me?
Does your love prefer the other?

She was dark and bright headed in a dream
Earning from a rise down to her knees
With some kind of love
Tonight I can't tell if it's love or hate
How smooth they are and quick to interchange
Some kind of love
I'll be the devil in your eye, if it's what you need to hear
I'll be the devil in your eye, if it'll change the way you feel
Hope my breath, I know it's me you're gonna blame
But my mother blamed my mood, it's all the same
Some kind of love
Tonight I can't tell if it's love or hate
How smooth they are and quick to interchange
Just some kind of love
I'll be the devil in your eye, if it's what you need to hear
I'll be the devil in your eye, if it'll change the way you feel
That's some kind of love, what are you holding on to?
Some kind of love when you're scared you're gonna lose
Some kind of love, what are you holding on to?
Some kind of love when you're scared you're gonna lose
Some kind of love, what are you holding on to?
Some kind of love
Some kind of love when you're scared you're gonna lose
Some kind of love
Some kind of love, what are you holding on to?

Some kind of love when you're scared you're gonna lose

I might be apart of this
Ripple on water from a lonesome drip
A fallen tree that witness me
I'm alone,
Him and me.
And then life it's self can not aspire
To have someone be so admired
I threw creation to my king
Have the silence broken by a whispered wind.
All of this can be broken
All of this can be broken
Hold your devil by his spoke
And spin him to the ground.
And root to root and tip to tip
I look at him my country gip
Let it up i own his fears
But someone brought you close to tears.
Many trains and many miles
Like you to me on this sunny isle
What of which you wish to speak
Have you come here to rescue me?
All of this can be broken
All of this can be broken
Hold your devil by his spoke
And spin him to the ground.
But the love of your life
Lives but lies no more
And where she lay
A flower grows.
The arms are fed
The babes have wed
And the backs have bled,
Keeping her in tow.
But i am keeper
And i hold your face away from light
I am yours 'till they come
I am yours 'till they come.
Eye to eye
Nose to nose
Ripping off eachothers clothes
In the most perculiar way.
Eye to eye
Nose to nose
Ripping off eachothers clothes
In the most perculiar way.

The young man stands on the edge of his porch
The days were short and the father was gone
There was no one in the town and no one in the field
This dusty barren land had given all it could yield
I've been kicked off my land at the age of sixteen
And I have no idea where else my heart could have been
I placed all my trust at the foot of this hill
And now I am sure my heart can never be still
So collect your courage and collect your horse
And pray you never feel this same kind of remorse
Seal my heart and break my pride
I've nowhere to stand and now nowhere to hide
Align my heart, my body, my mind
To face what I've done and do my time
Well you are my accuser, now look in my face
Your opression reeks of your greed and disgrace
So one man has and another has not
How can you love what it is you have got
When you took it all from the weak hands of the poor?
Liars and thieves you know not what is in store
There will come a time I will look in your eye
You will pray to the God that you've always denied
The I'll go out back and I'll get my gun
I'll say, "you haven't met me, I am the only son"
Seal my heart and break my pride
I've nowhere to stand and now nowhere to hide
Align my heart, my body, my mind
To face what I've done and do my time
Well yes sir, yes sir, yes it was me
I know what I've done, cause I know what I've seen
I went out back and I got my gun
I said, "you haven't met me, I am the only son".

Give me hope in silence
It's easier, it's kinder
And tell me not of heartbreak
It plagues my soul
It plagues my soul
We will meet back on this road
Nothing gained, truth be told
But I'm not the enemy
It isn't me, the enemy
But I came and I was nothing
Time will give us nothing
So why did you choose to lean on
A man you knew was falling?
Give me hope in silence
It's easier, it's kinder
And tell me not of heartbreak
It plagues my soul
It plagues my soul
And bury me beside you
I have no hope in solitude
And the world will follow
To the earth down below
But I came and I was nothing
Time will give us nothing
So why did you choose to lean on
A man you knew was falling?

I’m in a los angeles cathedral
Mine is singing out, sing for me
Put an ocean and a river between everybody ever between everybody else and home
Put an ocean and a river between everybody else and home
Put an ocean and a river between everybody ever between everybody else and home
Put an ocean and a river between everybody else and home
We must be somewhere in london
We must be loving our lives in the rain
We must be somewhere in london
Walking abbey lane
I don’t even think to make
I don’t even think to make
I don’t even think to make corrections
Famous angels never come to england
England gets the ones you never need
I’m in a los angeles cathedral
Mine is singing out, sing for me
Afraid of the house
Stay the night with the sinners
Afraid of the house
Stay the night with the sinners
Afraid of the house
Cause we’re desperate to entertain x3

Oh my
With downtown hair and high rise eyes
So naive to how the skyline lies
Must do nothing for your mind
I know I love you now
But will I love you then?
You can see it in my eyes
It doesn't really matter
Cos man, I'm cold
Man, I'm toothless
Man, my heart is so suddenly useless
What a fool you've landed
Oh oh oh, what a fool you call home
And you I'm amazed you held my gaze so long
With your down-home heart and skirt undone
Stood by the man that you call home
I know I love you now
But will I love you then?
You can see it in my eyes
It doesn't really matter
Cos man I'm cold
Man, I'm toothless
My love, my heart is so suddenly useless
What a fool you've landed
Oh oh oh, what a fool you call home

For those below
Helpless she lies across the stairs
Haunting your days consuming your breath
There will be healing but don't force this girl to stand
As she's counting the ceilings with pale voice and trembling hands
You told me life was long but now that it's gone
You find yourself on top as the leader of the flock
Called to be wrong for those below
Whispered notes from the piano in the corner of the room
Hold your throat is that healing that your hearing in her tune
Wanting change but loving her just as she lies
Is the burden of the man who's build his life on love
You told me life was long but now that it's gone
You find yourself on top as the leader of the flock
Called to be wrong for those below
I be locked up in store
In the lavender ward
Cause my mind is just like her's
Just as broken just as crippled just as burned
And then I find myself on top as the leader of the flock
Called to be wrong for those below

I lit out from Reno
I was trailed by twenty hounds
Didn't get to sleep last night
'Till the morning came around
Set out runnin' but I take my time
A friend of the devil is a friend of mine
If I get home before daylight
I just might get some sleep tonight
Ran into the devil, babe, he loaned me twenty bills
I spent the night in Utah in a cave up in the hills
Set out runnin' but I take my time
A friend of the devil is a friend of mine
If I get home before daylight
I just might get some sleep tonight
I ran down to the levee but the devil caught me there
He took my twenty dollar bill and vanished in the air
Set out runnin' but I take my time
A friend of the devil is a friend of mine
If I get home before daylight
I just might get some sleep tonight
Got two reasons why I cry away each lonely night
The first one's named sweet Anne Marie
And she's my hearts delight
The second one is prison, babe, the sheriff's on my trail
And if he catches up with me, I'll spend my life in jail
Got a wife in Chino, babe, and one in Cherokee
The first one says she's got my child, but it don't look like me
Set out runnin' but I take my time
A friend of the devil is a friend of mine
If I get home before daylight
I just might get some sleep tonight
Set out runnin' but I take my time
A friend of the devil is a friend of mine
If I get home before daylight
I just might get some sleep tonight

Lay back, lay back, go to sleep my man
Wipe the blood from you face and your hands
Forgive yourself if you think that you can
Go to sleep, go to sleep my man
Twenty-one days lost at sea i fought
For twenty-two years non-stop i've talked
Through the desert, pissed drunk, and confused i walked
I spit a tooth in the palm of my hand
Lay back, lay back, go to sleep my man
Wipe the blood from you face and your hands
Forgive yourself if you think that you can
Go to sleep, go to sleep my man
Well the wind and the trees are ganging up on me
They sing my funeral song in harmony
Well i just want to walk home on the drunk i need
But they keep singing and singing and singing to me...
La, la, la, la, la, la (i hear them singing)
La, la, la, la, la, la (singing for me)
La, la, la, la, la, la (oh!)
Well i wish things were different, true, and deep
But everything that's so shallow is everything about me
If only i could just take all my money and leave
I hope the people on the ground will understand
I hope the people out there will understand
Lay back, lay back, go to sleep my man
Wipe the blood from you face and your hands
Forgive yourself if you think that you can
Go to sleep, go to sleep my man
La, la
Go to sleep, go to sleep my man
La, la
Go to sleep, go to sleep my man

Once there was a way, to get back homeward.
Once there was a way, to get back home.
Sleep pretty darling, do not cry.
And i will sing a lullaby.
Golden slumbers fill your eyes.
Smiles await you when you rise.
Sleep pretty darling, do not cry.
And i will sing a lullaby.
Once there was a way, to get back homeward.
Once there was a way, to get back home.

Boy, you're gonna carry that weight
Carry that weight a long time
Boy, you're gonna carry that weight
Carry that weight a long time
I never give you my pillow
I only send you my invitations
And in the middle of the celebrations
I break down
Boy, you're gonna carry that weight
Carry that weight a long time
Boy, you're gonna carry that weight
Carry that weight a long time

1, 2, 3
All day permanent red
The glaze on my eyes
When I heard your voice
The distance caught me by surprise again
And I know you claim that you're alright
But fix your eyes on me
I guess I'm all you have
And I swear you'll see the dawn again
Well, I know I had it all on the line
But don't just sit with folded hands and become blind
'Cause even when there is no star in sight
You'll always be my only guiding light
Relate to my youth
Well, I'm still in awe of you
Discover some new truth
That was always wrapped around you
But don’t just slip away in the night
But don’t just hurl your words from on high
Well, I know I had it all on the line
But don't just sit with folded hands and become blind
'Cause even when there is no star in sight
You'll always be my only guiding light
If we come back and we’re broken
Unworthy and ashamed
Give us something to believe in
And you know we’ll go your way
'Cause I know I had it all on the line
But don't just sit with folded hands and become blind
'Cause even when there is no star in sight
You'll always be my only guiding light
And I know I had it all on the line
But don't just sit with folded hands and become blind

There is no great thing, to stop and sing
Waiting for the rain
And this perfect pill, it's all too much
On the edge again
Don't look away
Couldn't help but note the coldest thing
In your precious face
Why do you always speak when you have no grace
In your precious face
But even in the dark I saw you were the only one alone
But these hot gates you spent your victory on
Though your swore you wouldn't do this anymore
And I can't be for you all of the things you want me to
But I will love you constantly
There's precious little else to me
And though we cry, we must stay alive
Another fragile edge, and a tender sound
And then you went aground
Near a duller blade, a promise out of sight
There's nothing here for you tonight
But even in the dark I saw you were the only one alone
But these hot gates you spent your victory on
Though your swore you wouldn't do this anymore
And I can't be for you all of the things you want me to
But I will love you constantly
There's precious little else to me
And though we cry, we must stay alive
Let my blood only run out when my world decides
There is no way out of your only life
So run on, so run!

Can you stay up for the weekend?
And blame god for looking too old
Can you find all that you stand for?
Has been replaced with mountains of gold
You can untrain yourself to notice
To feel pain and swallow fear
But can you stay up for the weekend
To next year
God i can't do this anymore
Oh i'll be laid down on the floor
As many feet walk through the door
I'm not alone
If i see a light flashin'
Could this mean that i'm comin' home?
If i see a man waving
Does this mean that i'm not alone?

Hey, little girl, is your daddy home?
Did he go and leave you all alone?
I got a bad desire
Oooh, I'm on fire
Tell me now baby is he good to you?
Does he do to you the things that I do?
I can take you higher
Oooh, I'm on fire
Sometimes it's like someone took a knife, baby
Edgy and dull and cut a six-inch valley
Through the middle of my soul
At night I wake up with the sheets soaking wet
And a freight train running through the
Middle of my head
Only you can cool my desire
Oooh, I'm on fire
Oooh, I'm on fire
Oooh, I'm on fire

Living on the road my friend
Was gonna keep you free and clean
Now you wear your skin like iron
Your breath's as hard as kerosene
You weren't your mama's only boy
But her favorite one it seems
She began to cry when you said goodbye
And sank into your dreams
Pancho was a bandit boys
His horse was fast as polished steel
Wore his gun outside his pants
For all the honest world to feel
Pancho met his match you know
On the deserts down in mexico
Nobody heard his dying words
That's the way it goes
All the federales say
They could have had him any day
They only let him hang around
Out of kindness i suppose
Lefty he can't sing the blues
All night long like he used to
The dust that pancho bit down south
Ended up in lefty's mouth
The day they laid poor pancho low
Lefty split for ohio
Where he got the bread to go
There ain't nobody knows
All the federales say
They could have had him any day
They only let him slip away
Out of kindness i suppose
The poets tell how pancho fell
Lefty's livin' in a cheap hotel
The desert's quiet and cleveland's cold
So the story ends we're told
Pancho needs your prayers it's true,
But save a few for lefty too
He just did what he had to do
Now he's growing old
A few gray federales say
They could have had him any day
They only let him go so wrong
Out of kindness i suppose

I came here without a choice
I'm sorry I could never thank you
For saving me more trouble
I didn't want any trouble
If you were given one more chance
Would you bring me back to life?
Bring me back into the light
Into the light?
And let it shine on
Let it shine on us
And if I say I love you
Well, then I love you
And if I say I love you
Well, then I love you
The innocence in your face
Bled out without a trace
You've won without an enemy
You're ill without a remedy
As night bleeds into night
And I know I came off better than you
It doesn't mean that I feel better
It doesn't mean that I feel better
And let it shine on
Let it shine on us

Well, then I love you
And if I say I love you
Well, then I love you
And if I say I love you
Well, then I love you
And if I say I love you
Well, then I love you
Show me your hands
Are they cleaner than mine?
Show me your face
Did you cross the line?
Show me your eyes
Are they drier than mine?
Your soul survives
But peace you'll never find
And if I say I love you
Well, then I love you
And if I say I love you
Well, then I love you
And if I say I love you

With flaming locks of auburn hair

He talks about you in his sleep
And there's nothing I can do to keep
From crying when he calls your name, Jolene

Tell my thoughts to resign
And lift you from my mind
I'm not ready I'm not strong enough
To cradle the weight of your love
Just take a minute take a breath
Lay down your head on my sunken chest
I saw a flicker then just smoke
But as you left I was calling your name at the night
I thought we were done
And young love would keep us young
I thought we were done
And young love would keep us young
I thought we fell to the ground
I see you whimper with no sound
Open my mouth to breathe some words of peace
But the silence gives nothing back to me
So I'll be a shadow of the flame
I lent down to kiss you then erased my name
And I'll be a whisper on the wind
My hands are shaking from holding so tight for so long
The flame burnt out in our empty hands
But now I see it's got nothing to do
It's got nothing to do with you
(Why do I keep falling) I thought we were done
(Why do I keep falling) And young love would keep us young

Though i may speak
Some tongue of old
Or even spit out some holy word
I have no strength with which to speak
When you sit me down and see i’m weak
We will run and scream
You will dance with me
We’ll fulfill our dreams, and we’ll be free
We will run and scream
You will dance with me
We’ll fulfill our dreams, and we’ll be free
We will be who we are
And they’ll heal our scars
Sadness will be far away
So i have done wrong
To put me right
My judgement burned in the black of night
Then i give less than i take
It is my fault, my own mistake
We will run and scream
You will dance with me
We’ll fulfill our dreams, and we’ll be free

Come sing to me a song

I'd rather be in some dark holler
Where the sun don't never shine
Than to see you
And to know you'll never be mine

It's because my own true lover
Is waiting in the sky
Little birdie, little birdie
Come sing to me a song

Perhaps i'll be a bird one day
If i am good enough
And i'll spread out and fly way
And give up all this stuff
I am from a country land
Where beauty only grows
And though i'd love to leave some day
I'd dare not ever go
And should you see my sister
She is small and gold
They will not hear a word you say
They don't believe in souls
Perhaps i'll be a bird one day
If i am good enough
And i'll get up and fly way
And give up all this stuff
I am from a country land
Where beauty only grows
And though i'd dream to leave some day
I'd dare not ever go
And should you see my sister
They are small and gold
They will not hear a word you say
They don't believe in souls
I am no deceiver
I am a believer
I am no deceiver

Don't let me darken in your door
It's not what i came here for, no it's not what i came here for
And i won't hear you cry when i'm gone
I won't know if i'm doing you wrong, i never know if i'm doing you wrong
A constant reminder of where i can find her
Why am i blown away
Its all that i'm asking for, lover i've lost
My love don't fade away
Watch the world tear us apart
A stoic mind and a bleeding heart
You never see my bleeding heart
And your lights always shinning on
But i've been traveling oh so long
Well i've been traveling oh so long
A constant reminder of where i can find her
Why am i blown away
It's all that i'm asking for, lover i've lost
My love don't fade away
It goes without saying
But in love you just can't get out the way
Oh, but the other would stay
A constant reminder of where i can find her
Why am i blown away
It's all that i'm asking for, lover i've lost
My love don't fade away
A constant reminder of when i could find her
And i was blown away
It's all that i'm asking for, lover i've lost
My love don't fade away
My love don't fade away

<|startoftext|>
I was born a black boy
My name is emmett till
I walked this earth for 14 years
And one night i was killed
For speaking to a woman
Whose skin was white as dough
That's a sin in mississippi
But how was i to know?
I'd come down from chicago
To visit with my kin
Up there i was a cheeky kid
I guess i'd always been
But the harm they put upon me
Was too hard for what i'd done
For i was just a black boy
And never hurt no one
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
They took me from my uncle's house
Mose wright was his name.
He'd later stand and, without hesitation,
Point the blame
At the ones who beat and cut me
And shot me with a gun
And threw me in the river
Like i was trash when they were done
I was sent back to my mother,
At least what was left of me,
She kept my casket open
For the whole wide world to see
The awful desecration
And the evidence of hate
You could not recognize me
The mutilation was so great
There came a cry for justice
To be finally fulfilled
All because of me, a black boy
My name is emmett till
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh, but i'd have rather lived
'till i was too old to die young
Not miss all i left behind
And all that might have come
Summer clouds above my head
The grass beneath my feet
The warmth of a good woman
Her kisses soft and sweet
Perhaps to be a father
With a black boy of my own
Watch him grow into a kinder world
Than i had known
Where no child would be murdered
For the colour of his skin
And love would be the only thing
Inside the hearts of men
They say the horror of that night
Is haunting heaven still
Where i am one more black boy
My name is emmett till

Every town
Has its ups and down
Sometime ups
Outnumber the downs
But not in nottingham
I'm inclined to believe
If we were so down
We'd up and leave
We'd up and fly if we had wings for flyin'
Can't you see the tears we're cryin'?
Can't there be some happiness for me?
Not in nottingham

I came home
Like a stone
And I fell heavy into your arms
These days of dust
Which we've known
Will blow away with this new sun
And I'll kneel down
Wait for now
And I'll kneel down
Wait for now
So break my step
And relent
You forgave and I won't forget
Know what we've seen
And him with less
Now in some way
Shake the excess
And I'll kneel down
Wait for now
And I'll kneel down
Know my ground
Now I'll be bold
As well as strong
Use my head alongside my heart
So take my flesh
And fix my eyes
That tethered mind free from the lies
And I'll kneel down
Wait for now
And I'll kneel down
Know my ground
And I'll kneel down
Wait for now
Raise my hands
Paint my spirit gold
And bow my head
Keep my heart slow
And raise my hands
Paint my spirit gold
And bow my head
Keep my heart slow

In the silver light
I just made out
Your silhouette
Through the quickening haze
So brand it on my mind
So I don't forget
Let it shine
On my wandering eyes
Ooh, your love endures
Ooh, I have faith for the rest
I'm blinded by the lights
Of October skies
These postcard memories
Evade my eyes
And in the valley I'm free
But in the hills I soar
'Til your silhouette
Is gone once more
Ooh, your love endures
Ooh, I have hope once more
The fear of what's to come
Has been crippling me
So to your silhouette
I turn once more
So brand it on my mind
So I won't forget
Let it shine, let it shine
By my wandering eyes
Oh, let it shine, let it shine
By my wandering eyes
Ooh, your love endures
Ooh, I have hope once more

Loneliness and all, I was stuck to the spot without a friend
Alone again, and I hunger and I thirst for some shiver
For some whispered words and the promise to come
And you saw me low,
Alone again
Didn't they say that only love will win in the end?
I didn't fool me but I failed you, in short
Made a fool out of you, the younger heart
And I rage, and I rage, but perhaps I will come of age
And be ready for you
And you saw me low,
Alone again
Didn't they say that only love will win in the end?
Didn't they say that only love will win in the end?
And you saw me low,
Alone again
Didn't they say that only love will win in the end?

If I could tell you no
I thought it best you didn't know
Don't see it coming
The darkness visible
But when its eyes fix mine
It's silver and it's stone
I feel it rising, oh
The gathering storm
And when I feel that darkness
Is a heartbeat away
And I don't know how to fight it
It's a heartbeat away
And now you don't know me like this
It's a heartbeat away
And I don't know how to hide it
It's a heartbeat away
And I picture you
Soaked in light
I picture you
And in you I have no doubt
When the chaos calls me out
And it feels like there is nothing I can do
I'll picture you
And the night falls fast
I know it's heavy on the skin
Will it be ever thus?
Barely visible
But when your eyes fix mine
Embracing your denial
Well, I hold my breath
Through the waste and the wild
But when I feel it rising
And it's a heartbeat away
And I don't know how to fight it
It's a heartbeat away
And now you don't know me like this
It's a heartbeat away
And I don't know how to fight it
It's a heartbeat away
And I picture you
Soaked in light
I picture you
And in you I have no doubt
When the chaos calls me out
And it feels like there is nothing I could do
I'll picture you

Fold your hair behind your ears
Roll your questions across the floor
I know we've been here for years
But at least we've been here before
My mind finds peace in the shade of your attention
But gets tangled by the night
I didn't know what I was thinking, but I know we’ll be alright
And I will surround you
With a love too deep for words
Hold you from the world and its curse
So long as I have breath in my lungs
Long as there's a song to be sung
I will be yours and you will be mine
Ever our lives entwined
My rose of Sharon
My rose of Sharon
Come crashing in like a wildfire, I'm left in awe of you
Every time I close the door, I’m left wanting more of you
I wish I had some grand sense of occasion
But I just smile and turn away
I hope you know by now I don't know another way
When it's said and done
I'm yours forever
Like I said, I'm done
I'm yours forever
I will surround you
With a love too deep for words
Hold you from the world and its curse
So long as I have breath in my lungs
Long as there's a song to be sung
I will be yours and you will be mine
Ever our lives entwined
My rose of Sharon
My rose of Sharon
With a love too deep for words
I’m yours forever
With a love too deep for words
I’m yours forever
With a love too deep for words
I'm yours forever
With a love too deep for words
I’m yours forever

She said yes, she said yes
She said yes, she said yes
Praise the lord, glory hallelujah
She said yes, she said yes
As the summer sun set in south carolina
You flew all the way to ask her father
He made you ride bitch and stripped you of your pride
You knew it was no easy ride
But she said yes, she said yes
She said yes, she said yes
Praise the lord, glory hallelujah
She said yes, she said yes
Down on one knee, the piano player waiting
Get out the wring, your voice is breaking
This is the loneliest you'll ever be
We can't get you out of this squeeze
She said yes, she said yes
She said yes, she said yes
Praise the lord, glory hallelujah
She said yes, she said yes
So you've come pretty far from your wedding day
I'm proud of you brother i have to say
You weathered the storms and you followed our dreams
And now it's just you and your queen
She said yes, she said yes
She said yes, she said yes
Praise the lord, glory hallelujah
She said yes, she said yes
She said yes, she said yes
She said yes, she said yes
Praise the lord, glory hallelujah

There's a chip on your shoulder, girl
And by God it'll make you fall
If you let it take a part of your soul
I see the love in your brother's eyes
And the love in your mother's cries
Sister don't test the ones you love
Sister don't let go
Sister don't let go of us
[x2]
Cause your roots will rot away
And your fruit, it wont grow
Your bark will wear thin, body hollow
I see the love in your brother's eyes
And the love in your mother's cries
Sister don't test the ones you love
Sister don't let go
Sister don't let go of us

No more questions, no more lies
Do a deal for no surprises
'Cause you will never slip away
Slip away in the night
Waiting patient for the sun to rise
Ii reveals a stoic smile
But you will never slip away
Slip away in the night
You'll find me waiting here for you
Come and suffer here
You'll find me holding my breath for you
Come and suffer here
In the violence of a mind's eye
We had a deal for no surprises
'Cause you will never slip away
Slip away in the night
But you're not yourself
I know you better than you
But you're not yourself
I know you better than you
You'll find me holding my breath for you
It's never more than I can take
I wouldn't have it any other way
You'll find me on my knees for you
It's never more than I can take

Be still and love
Go gently now
Be still and love
Go gently now

A fair irish girl has kept my eyes still
And if she doesn't know i love her she soon enough will
'cause i'll head to heathrow with a rose in my hand
And i'll run it to her as soon as i land
So much to say and so much to share
For one-night lovers or a lifelong pair
Susie susie lead me home
My misguided feet have driven me wrong
I'm a long lost lover and i stand alone
So susie susie lead me home
If it stole you eyes
Would you ask them back from me?
If i wrote you this song
Would you dance to it down grafton street?
If whisked you away
Would you weigh light in my arms?
When we leave this world
Will our love linger on?
Susie susie lead me home
My misguided feet have driven me wrong
I'm a long lost lover and i stand alone
So susie susie lead me home
And i went to dublin to look for you suze
It wasn't long before i found myself alone at o'donoghue's
Another misadventure by my misguided feet
I just sat and i hummed this tune as my toes tapped the beat
Susie susie lead me home
My misguided feet have driven me wrong
I'm a long lost lover and i stand alone
So susie susie lead me home

Bite chunks out of me
You're a shark and I'm swimming
My heart still thumps as I bleed
And all your friends come sniffing
Triangles are my favourite shape
Three points where two lines meet
Toe to toe, back to back, let's go
My love it's very late
'Til morning comes, mmmm
Let's tessellate.
Go alone my flower
And keep my whole lovely you
Wild green stones alone my lover
And keep us on my heart
Three guns and one goes off
One's empty, one's not quick enough
One burn, one red, one grin
Search the graves while the camera spins
Chunks of you will sink down to the seals
Blubber rich the in mourning
They'll nosh you up, yes they'll nosh the love away, but it's fair to say
You will still haunt me
Triangles are my favourite shape
Three points where two lines meet
Toe to toe, back to back, let's go
My love it's very late
'Til morning comes, mmmm
Let's tessellate.

The brightest lights cast the darkest shadows
And that’s where i’ll be found
For what’s hiding by the morning
Will be chased by daylight’s hounds
Oh the dawn light sweeps all the shadows clean
Of what has gathered in the night
Hang the villains and the crooks, high on butchers hooks
As they run from the sun in fright
Oh the moonlight shadows are fleeting and scattered
Where memories and prophecies are slain
Only the moment you’re in can delight in sin
So forget your regrets and pains
The brightest lights cast the darkest shadows
And that’s where i’ll be found
For what’s hiding by the morning
Will be chased by daylight’s hounds
Well the twilight shivers as darkness is risen
Cold ash poured over the sun
For the sun to rise again, he must go through hell
To see what the darkness has done
The depraved are tamed, caught in pleasures chains
Are willingly surrendering
There’s a song to your soul while you bow to gold
This song the angels sing
The brightest lights cast the darkest shadows
And that’s where i’ll be found
For what’s hiding by the morning
Will be chased by daylight’s hounds
The brightest lights cast the darkest shadows
And that’s where i’ll be found
For what’s hiding by the morning
Will be chased by daylight’s hounds
The brightest lights cast the darkest shadows
And that’s where i’ll be found
For what’s hiding by the morning
Will be chased by daylight’s hounds

Listen to the wind blow
Watch the sun rise
Run in the shadows
Damn your love
Damn your lies
And if
You don't love me now
You will never love me again
I can still hear you saying
You would never break the chain.
List to the wind blow
Down comes the night
Run in the shadows
Damn your love
Damn your lies
Break the silence
Damn the dark
Damn the light
And if
You don't love me now
You will never love me again
I can still hear you saying
You would never break the chain.

Give me hope in silence
It's easier, it's kinder
Tell me not of heartbreak
It plagues my soul, it plagues my soul
We will meet back on this road
Nothing gained, truth be told
But I'm not the enemy
It isn't me the enemy
But I came and I was nothing
And time will give us nothing
So why did you choose to lean on
A man you knew was falling?
Give me hope in silence
It's easier, it's kinder
Tell me not of heartbreak
It plagues my soul, it plagues my soul
And burry me beside you
I have no hope in solitude
And the world will follow
To the earth down below
But I came and I was nothing
And time will give us nothing
So why did you choose to lean on
A man you knew was falling?

I pulled into Nazareth, was feelin' about half past dead;
I just need find a place where I can rest my head.
"Hey, mister, will you tell me where a man might find a bed?"
He just grinned and shook my hand, and "No!", was all he said.
Take a load off Fanny, take a load for free
Take a load off Fanny, and (and)
Put the load right on me.
I picked up my bag, I went lookin' for a place to hide
When I saw Carmen and the Devil walkin' side by side.
I said, "Hey, Carmen, come on, let's go downtown."
She said, "I got to go, but my friend can stick around."
Take a load off Fanny, take a load for free
Take a load off Fanny, and (and)
You put the load on me.
Go down, Miss Moses, there's nothin' you can say
It's just ol' Luke, and Luke is waitin' on the Judgement Day.
"Well, Luke, my friend, what about young Anna Lee?"
He said, "Do me a favour, son, woncha stay an' keep Anna Lee company?"
Take a load off Fanny, take a load for free
Take a load off Fanny, and (and)
You put the load on me
Crazy Chester followed me, and he caught me in the fog.
He said, "I'll fix your rack, if you'll take Jack, my dog."
I said, "Wait a minute, Chester, you know I'm a peaceful man."
He said, "That's okay, boy, won't you feed him when you can."
Take a load off Fanny, take a load for free
Take a load off Fanny, and (and)
You put the load on me.
Take a load off Fanny, take a load for free

We saw birth and death
Can't we be still?
What makes you kind?
From where comes your sparkling mind?
Was it under the earth?
Tied up in a knot
Which I forgot you were ever there?
Do not be afraid
Do not be afraid
What’s that I see?
I think it's the wild
Puts the fear of God in me
It was ever thus
Up from the dust
Inconceivable love
What's that I see?
I think it’s the wild
Puts the fear of God in me

This time tomorrow where will we be
On a spaceship somewhere sailing across an empty sea
This time tomorrow what will we know
Well we still be here watching an in-flight movie show
I'll leave the sun behind me and watch the clouds as they sadly pass me by
Seven miles below ma i can see the world and it ain't so big at all
This time tomorrow what will we see
Field full of houses, endless rows of crowded streets
I don't where i'm going, i don't want to see
I feel the world below me looking up at me
Leave the sun behind me, and watch the clouds as they sadly pass me by
And i'm in perpetual motion and the world below doesn't matter much to me
This time tomorrow where will we be
On a spaceship somewhere sailing across any empty sea
This time tomorrow, this time tomorrow

Spare me your judgements and spare me your dreams
Cause recently mine have been tearing my seams
I sit alone in this winter clarity which clouds my mind
Alone in the wind and the rain you left me
It's getting dark darling, too dark to see
And I'm on my knees, and your faith in shreds, it seems
Corrupted by the simple sniff of riches blown
I know you have felt much more love than you've shown
And I'm on my knees and the water creeps to my chest
But plant your hope with good seeds
Don't cover yourself with thistle and weeds
Rain down, rain down on me
Look over your hills and be still
The sky above us shoots to kill
Rain down, rain down on me
But I will hold on
I will hold on hope
I begged you to hear me, there's more than flesh and bones
Let the dead bury the dead, they will come out in droves
But take the spade from my hands and fill in the holes you've made
But plant your hope with good seeds
Don't cover yourself with thistle and weeds
Rain down, rain down on me

Come roll around with me on the floor.

You live your life through these open doors.

Take my eyes
And my whole heart in your hands
In your hands
In your hands
And board the yard as in departs
Lead me on the shore
But I will hunt no more
Hold my sin above my head
And take me home instead
Take me home instead
I will not speak of your sin
There is a way out for him
The mirror shows not
Your values are all shocked
The door, my heart was floored,
I knew my weakness
Oh hold
My hand can sign me not to darkness
You know, my heart was floored,
I knew my weakness
Oh hold,

I don’t want to leave this train
A world of weights with its fames
Got me thinkin’ of the times
We were runnin’ down the lines
And i got sweet dreams forever
On a train in the sky
California to new orleans
And all that country in between
New friends from old lives playin’ through the night
Singing sweet dreams forever on a train in the sky.
Oooh can you hear it, that whistle blow
And oooh can you feel it take your load
Music and laughter, hearing people sing
We got sweet dreams forever,
Oh let it ring, let it ring
Sweet dreams forever on a train in the sky.
Well the end came softly in the night
A golden circle shown its light
Though we say goodbye
May these friendships never die
We’ll have sweet dreams forever on a train the sky.
We’ll have sweet dreams forever on a train in the sky, sky, sky.
Forever on a train in the sky.
Train in the sky.

I feel as if i've been where you have been
The snow had piled up knee-high in the street
Apart, apart
And dancing on
The wanderer
The squanderer
Our son was dying and we could hardly eat
They dragged me by the ankles through the street (two hearts)
They passed me round them like a piece of meat
His hairy hands
His falling fists
His dancing cock
Down by his knees
I've seen my children turn away from me
O, do you want my bones between your teeth?
They pulled me half-alive out of the sea
Apart, apart
And dancing on
Impossible
Impossible
I feel as if i've been where you have been
I feel as if i've been where you have been

Just give me a second darling
To clear my head
Just put down those scissors baby, on this single bed
The sand in the hourglass is running low
I came through thunder, the cold wind
The rain, and the snow
To find you awake by your windowsill
A sight for sore eyes and a view to kill
I broke down in horror at you standing there
The glow from the moon
Shone through cracks in your hair.
I shouted with passion,
"I love you so much"
But feeling my skin, it was cold to the touch.
You whispered, "Where are you?"
I questioned your doubt
But soon realized, you were talking to God now.
But, you have blood on your hands
And I know it's mine
I just need more time
So get off your low and let's dance like we used to
And there's a light in the distance
Waiting for me, and I will wait for you
So get off your low and let's kiss like we used to
I looked in the mirror
Bust something was wrong.
I saw you behind but my reflection was gone.
There was smoke in the fireplace
As white as the snow.
A voice beckoned gently,
"Now it's time to go"
A requiem played as you begged for forgiveness
"Don't touch me," I screamed,
"I've got unfinished business!"
But, you've got blood on your hands
And I know it's mine
I just need more time
So get off your low and let's dance like we used to
And there's a light in the distance
Waiting for me, and I will wait for you
So get off your low and let's kiss like we used to
Cause, you've got blood on your hands
And I know it's mine
I just need more time
So get off your low and let's dance like we used to
And there's a light in the distance
Waiting for me, and I will wait for you
So get off your low and let's kiss like we used to

I came home
Like a stone
And I fell heavy into your arms
These days of dust
which we've known
will blow away with this new sun
And I'll kneel down, wait for now
And I'll kneel down, wait for now
So break my step
And relent
Well you forgave
And I won't forget
Know what we've seen
And him with less
Know in some way
Shake the excess
And I'll kneel down, wait for now
And I'll kneel down, know my ground
Now I'll be bold, as well as strong
And use my head alongside my heart
So take my flesh
And fix my eyes
And tear the night free from the lies
And I'll kneel down, wait for now
And I'll kneel down, know my ground
I'll kneel down, wait for now
Raise my hands
Paint my spirit gold
Bow my head
Keep my heart slow
Raise my hands
Paint my spirit gold
Bow my head
Keep my heart slow

Headed down south to the land of the pines
I'm thumbin' my way into north caroline
Starin' up the road
And pray to god i see headlights
I made it down the coast in seventeen hours
Pickin' me a bouquet of dogwood flowers
And i'm a hopin' for raleigh
I can see my baby tonight
So rock me mama like a wagon wheel
Rock me mama anyway you feel
Hey mama rock me
Rock me mama like the wind and the rain
Rock me mama like a south-bound train
Hey mama rock me
Runnin' from the cold up in new england
I was born to be a fiddler in an old-time string band
My baby plays the guitar
I pick a banjo now
Oh, the north country winters keep a gettin' me now
Lost my money playin' poker so i had to up and leave
But i ain't a turnin' back
To livin' that old life no more
Walkin' to the south out of roanoke
I caught a trucker out of philly
Had a nice long toke
But he's a headed west from the cumberland gap
To johnson city, tennessee
And i gotta get a move on fit for the sun
I hear my baby callin' my name
And i know that she's the only one
And if i die in raleigh
At least i will die free

There were moments of dreams i was offered to save
I live less like a workhorse, more like a slave
I thought that one quick moment that was noble or brace
Would be worth the most of my life.
So i pointed my fingers, and shout a few quotes i knew
As if something that's written should be taken as true
But every path i have taken and conclusion i drew
Would put truth back under the knife.
And now the only piece of advice that continues to help:
Is anyone that's making anything new only breaks something else.
When my time comes,
Ohhhhh, oh oh oh.
When my times comes,
Ohhhhh, oh oh oh.
So i took what i wanted and put it out of my reach
I wanted to pay for my successes with all my defeats,
And if heaven was all that was promised to me
Why don't i pray for death?
And now it seems like the unraveling has started too soon,
Now i'm sleeping in hallways and i'm drinking perfume
And i'm speaking to mirrors and i'm howling at moons
While the worst and the worst that it gets.
Oh you can judge all the world on the sparkle that you think it lacks.
Yes you can stare into the abyss, but it's staring right back.
When my time comes,
Ohhhhh, oh oh oh.
When my time comes,
Ohhhhh, oh oh oh.

Where is my heart, girl
Where is my heart
Did you throw it in a blender or throw it beneath a car
Did you give it to a doctor to dissect apart
I'm not joking anymore, girl

Did you give it to a doctor to dissect apart
I'm not joking anymore, girl
Where is my heart
Oh where is my tongue, girl
Where is my tongue
Did you go ahead and suck it out when you sucked out my lungs
You know that without it my song cannot be sung
I'm not joking anymore, girl
Where is my tongue
Beers, browns, and banjos
Is that all I need
I looked up at the sky and I got down on my knees
Oh lord for Christmas wont you find me a wife
I will play her my banjo and she'll give me... a life!
Oh Where is my heart, girl
Where is my heart
Did you throw it in a blender or throw it beneath a car
Did you give it to a doctor to dissect apart
I'm not joking anymore, girl
Where is... my heart!

What would you think if I sang out of tune?
Would you stand up and walk out on me?
Lend me your ears and I'll sing you a song,
I'll try not to sing out of key.
I get by with a little help from my friends,
I get high with a little help from my friends,
Gonna try with a little help from my friends.
What do I do when my love is away?
(Does it worry you to be alone?)
How do I feel by the end of the day?
(Are you sad because you're on your own?)
I get by with a little help from my friends,
I get high with a little help from my friends,
Gonna try with a little help from my friends
Do you need anybody?
I need someone to love.
Could it be anybody?
Oh, I need someone to love.
I get by with a little help from my friends,
I get high with a little help from my friends,
Gonna try with a little help from my friends.
Would you believe in a love at first sight?
Yes I'm certain that it happens all the time.
What do you see when you turn out the light?
I can't tell you, but I know it's mine.
I get by with a little help from my friends,
I get high with a little help from my friends,
Gonna try with a little help from my friends.
Do you need anybody?
I don't know,
Could it be anybody?
Oh, I need someone to love.
I get by with a little help from my friends,
Gonna try with a little help from my friends.
I get high with a little help from my friends,
I get by with a little help from my friends,
With a little help from my friends.

You don't wanna turn away this time
Then why don't you take a different line
Don't have to be cruel to be kind
You don't have to lose your mind
You don't wanna suffer for your art
You don't wanna vivisect your heart
And then if you're falling apart
You're probably trying too hard
In the dawning light I found you breathless
But I won't deny I love you helpless
[Baaba Maal in Pulaar language]
You don't wanna say what you don't mean
You still want to paint a figure scene
You hide in the wings with a lamp
And cast the shadows on a screen
You don't wanna sing what you can say
Well that's quite a hard game to play
But I've fallen for your ways
In spite of myself I don't want you to change
But in the dawning light I found you breathless
But I won't deny I love you helpless
Wona
Wona
Wona
Wona
In the dawning light I found you breathless
But I won't deny I love you helpless
And I will be yours (wona)
And you will be mine (wona)
And I will be yours (wona)
And you will be mine (wona)

The things i don't want to do, i just keep doing
The things i want to do, i can't do
What a wretched man i am becoming
What a wretched man i have become
Who will save me
From this body of death that is looming
From this funeral parlor i keep on seeing
In the corner of my eye while pointing my gun
In the corner of my mind while ignoring the sun
It's coming for me, it's coming for me
But what you ask just cannot be done
A spineless heart is what i've become
The weight on my back is just too heavy
A holy life just wasn't for me
Keep smearing my heart, all over my sleeve
Someone comes and wipes it off and takes it from me
What's left is hardly mine but just a shadow of myself
For i find that i'm entwined, in a battle over my health
And i can't win, and i can't win
But what you ask just cannot be done
A weight heart is what i've become
The sweat on my back was just too heavy
A holy life just wasn't for me, a holy life just wasn't for me
But what you ask just cannot be done
A spineless heart is what i've become
The weight on my back was just too heavy
You say a holy life still waits for me
You say a holy life still waits for me

Kate wasn't in to moderation
That's what led to her frustration
With the state of her crumbling heart
She'd say "i'm not a girl for temperance",
Though i know it's at my heart's expense
But a downward spiral has to have a rock bottom.
She painted the walls with blue and green
She'd sing about her lovers and dreams and
Explain her hopeless desperation
Take off your shoes unravel your blues
This place is full of beggars and choosers
But the consequence of her liberty is bad
But my heart wants to go one way my mind don't agree
Cause they, they have fallen out recently
"know thy self" she said as she guided me round
The land of the dead
Introducing her friend stuck in the same mess
Ships might be built for sailing, my love, an easel's made for painting
But you ain't no sailor and i'll never be camera shy
My hear wants to go one way my mind don't agree
Cause they, they have fallen out recently
Well she said
"will i praise again? oh will i praise again?"
Cause my heart wants to go on where my mind don't agree
And they, they have fallen out recently
Well she said,
"oh will i praise again?"
"oh will i praise again?"
"will i, will i sing again?"
"will i, praise again?"

One soft infested summer
Me and Terry became friends
Trying in vain to breathe
The fire we born in
Catching rides to the outskirts
Tying faith between our teeth
Sleeping in that old abandoned beach house
Getting wasted in the heat
And hiding on the backstreets
Hiding on the backstreets
With a love so hard and filled with defeat
Running for our lives at night on them backstreets
Slow dancing in the dark
On the beach at Stockton's Wing
Where desperate lovers park
We sat with the last of the Duke Street Kings
Huddled in our cars
Waiting for the bells that ring
In the deep heart of the night
We let lose of everything
To go running on the backstreets
Running on the backstreets
Terry you swore we'd live forever
Taking it on them backstreets together
Endless juke joints and Valentino drag
Where famous dancers scraped the tears
Up off the street dressed down in rags
Running into the darkness
Some hurt bad some really dying
At night sometimes it seemed
You could hear the whole damn city crying
Blame it on the lies that killed us
Blame it on the truth that ran us down
You can blame it all on me Terry
It don't matter to me now
When the breakdown hit at midnight
There was nothing left to say
But I hated him
And I hated you when you went away
Laying here in the dark
You're like an angel on my chest
Just another tramp of hearts
Crying tears of faithlessness
Remember all the movies, Terry
We'd go see
Trying to learn to walk like the heroes
We thought we had to be
Well after all this time
To find we're just like all the rest
Stranded in the park
And forced to confess
To hiding on the backstreets
Hiding on the backstreets
Where we swore forever friends
On the backstreets until the end
Hiding on the backstreets
Hiding on the backstreets

Take me now baby here as I am
Hold me close, try and understand
Desire is hunger is the fire I breathe
Love is a banquet on which we feed
Come on now try to understand
The way I feel when I'm in your hand
Take my hand come undercover
They can't hurt you now
Can't hurt you now
Can't hurt you now
Because the night belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to us
Because the night belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to us
Have I doubt when I am alone
Love is a ring on the thelephone
Love is an angel disguised as lust
Love is our bed until the morning comes
Come on now try to understand
The way I feel under your command
Take my hands and the sun descends
They can't touch you now
Can't touch you now
Can't touch you now
Because the night belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to us
Because the night belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to us
Your love is here and now
The vicious circle turns and burns without
Though I can not live forgive me now
The time has come to take this moment and
They can't hurt you now
Because the night belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to us
Because the night belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to us
Because the night belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to us
Because the night belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to us
Because the night belongs to lovers

Gettin' ready
Gonna get my pay from the union man
Runnin' light

They're still racing at the Trestles
But that blood it never burned in her veins
Now I hear she's got a house up in Fairview
And a style she's trying to maintain
Well if she wants to see me
You can tell her that I'm easily found
Tell her there's a spot out 'neath Abram's Bridge
And tell here there's a
Darkness on the edge of town
Everybody's got a secret Sonny
Something that they just can't face
Some folks spend their whole lives trying to keep it
They carry it with them every step that they take
Till some day they just cut it loose
Cut it loose or let it drag 'em down
Where no one asks any questions
Or looks too long in your face
In the darkness on the edge of town
Some folks are born into a good life
Other folks get it anyway anyhow
I lost my money and I lost my wife
Then things don't seem to matter much to me now
Tonight I'll be on that hill 'cause I can't stop
I'll be on that hill with everything I got
Lives on the line where dreams are found and lost
I'll be there on time and I'll pay the cost
For wanting things that can only be found
In the darkness on the edge of town

Dogs of war
Dogs of war
Dogs of war
You've been a pattern man
Let go, I guess you can
Don't need to feel your touch
Right underneath the lights
Taking all you can
Rich game it ain't in plans
Feel the booths up on the ground
Talk and blew it all around
Stanch and the bullets
Shooting the whistles, soldiers of fortune
Searching premade, face the game, marching everything
We'll be the dogs of war
We'll be the dogs of war, dogs of war
Send me with dogs of war
I'll find, find in the night, granary or grinding fight
Keep it tight and keep it laugh when the smile
Stanch and the bullets
Shutting the whistles, soldiers are a fortune
Searching premade, face the game, marching everything
We'll be the dogs of war
We'll be the dogs of war, dogs of war

She's an idle child, high
Society
Never pushed a broom, not
Physically
Her eyes are down on you,
Her nose is up
Never spill your whiskey
When she fill your cup
I'm on the borderline
She can spread them round
And she shows them off
With a neon sign saying
Don't you touch
Between the devil and the
Deep blue sea
She use me like a begger to
Get a hold on me
[chorus]
On the borderline, she's a
Danger sign
On the borderline, getting
Out of line
On the borderline, but it
Feels so good
On the borderline, on the
Borderline
On the borderline,
Borderline
(here goes)
You know i shoot the dice to
Claim my dream
You pull them in without a
Thought to me
She's come to watch you and
Your pocket is dry (?)
The queen of hearts will
Kill you when the ace is
High
On the borderline
She's an idle child, high
Society
Never pushed a broom, not
Physically
Her eyes are down on you,
Her nose is up
Never spill your whiskey
When she fill your cup
Gonna meet you there
If you want me, meet me on
The borderline

If you're burned down on booze, got nothing to lose
Run out of money, disposable blues
Sleazy hotels, like living in hell
The girls on the hustle with nothing to sell
Want something for nothing, it's always the same
Keep pushing and shoving, and I'm down on the game
Always in trouble, forever detained
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
And good riddance to bad luck
Well spread out the news, there's a free man loose
Back out of jail, and chasing for flues
Padlocks and chains, broken the chains
Lay down a claim for monetary gains
Wonder what's coming out for the take
Freedom for loving and lust for the taste
Eyes are wide open, (wild?) to the game
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
And good riddance to bad luck

Zero low, go on now slow
Make it quick, and make a body shake
They'll try to hold you down
They can put ya round
They tryna hold you back
Get ya on a rail track
Hard times, goin' south
Don't you care for mine?
I'm not gonna make it far
Feelin' rough the time
Heart pumpin', feet are jumpin'
It's hard lovin', keeps me runnin'
They'll try to hold you down

They tryna hold you back
Get ya on a rail track

Don't you cross the line

Hard time, diddo time
Find me down the line
Hard times, get on by
Make it for me blind
Hard times is hard times, she'll be good to me
Hard times, hard times, she'll be good to me
Hard times, been on sand, don't you cross the land
Hard times, get on by, make it worth the?
Hard times, been on sand, don't you cross the land

The tour is over and I'm goin' home
Home to my baby, the bike of my own
So good to hear her, so nice and so clean
Hard to believe it, she's just like a dream
We're drivin' out to the countryside
Buy a sixpack we've got the time
I'm gonna tell my girl to move
'cause I´ve got real love to prove
Anytime I wanna, everytime I can
I'll escape on my Harley-Davidson
Anytime I wanna, everytime I can
I'll escape on the highway
Gonna get married as soon as we can
When I tell the church, the shit hits the fan
I'm gonna buy her all the gas she needs
Fill her up with lve, burning on the wheels
We're drivin' out to the countryside
Makin' love in the morning light
Don't have to pray for her to stay
'cause I´ve got my bike anyway
(Chorus)
Fire !
plop !

Honey roll over
And lettuce on top
Strap you to the bed
And make you rock
Run it up the flag
Send it on home
Push you to the wall
And make you moan
She's mine
Take what I want
Get what I need
Don't take it all
So don't you hide
Gonna blow my mind
C'mon taste it honey cause she feel fine
She turn it on, upside down
She turn me on, inside out
She turn it on, all around
She turn me on, she turn it on
Honey bend over
Touch your toes
She take over
The bomb explodes
A rockin' roller coaster
Flyin' off the top
Take you high diving
Off the long drop
She's mine
Take what I want
Get what I need
Don't take it all
Don't you hide
Gonna blow my mind
C'mon taste it honey cause she feel fine
She turn it on, upside down
She turn me on, inside out

Deep down in Louisiana close to New Orleans
Way back up in the woods among the evergreens
There stood a log cabin made of earth and wood
Where lived a country boy named Johnny B. Goode
Who never ever learned to read or write so well
But he could play a guitar just like a-ringin' a bell
Go, go, go Johnny go
Go, go Johnny go
Go, go Johnny go
Go, go Johnny go
Go Johnny B. Goode
He used to carry his guitar in a gunny sack
Go sit beneath the tree by the railroad track
Oh! The engineers would see him sittin' in the shade
Strummin' with the rhythm that the drivers made
People passing by they would stop and say
Oh my but that little country boy can play
Go, go, go Johnny go
Go, go Johnny go
Go, go Johnny go
Go, go Johnny go
Go Johnny B. Goode
His mama told him some day you will be a man
And you will be the leader of a big old band
Many people comin' from miles around
To hear you play your music till the sun go down
Maybe some day your name will be in lights
Sayin' Johnny B. Goode tonight
Go, go, go Johnny go
Go, go, go Johnny go
Go, go, go Johnny go
Go, go, go Johnny go
Go, Johnny B. Goode

He says two women is trouble,
Sweat out a duel, I'm humming right at you,

Commin' on at night,

You've gotta run away and hide,

That paint the hills as far as you can see
And that's where I while away my hours
Hours of eternity
In a little tin shed on the hillside
Where we sit and drink our peppermint tea
And the candlelight flickers inside
'Cos we havent got electricity
But I know I've found peace in Carey Gully
And I haven't known that state of mind before
And I sing as I walk down in the valley
'Cos those city things don't bother me no more
Well it's taken such a long time to get there
And we've travelled a long winding road
Now I sit in my old rocking chair
And my darling I never will go

Baby we was making straight A's
But we was stuck in the dumb days
Don't take much to memorize your lies
I feel like I've been hypnotisized
And then that magic man he come to town
Whoo wee
He done spun my head around
Said recess is in session
Two and two make five
And now baby
I'm alive
Oh yeah
I'm alive
And if you wanna be the teacher's pet
Well baby you just better forget
Rock got no reason
Rock got no rhyme
You better get me to school on time
Oh you know I was on the honor role
Got good grades
And got no soul
Raise my hand before I can speak my mind
I've been biting my tongue too many times
And then that magic man said to obey
(uh huh)
Do what magic man do
Not what magic man say
Now could I please have the attention of the class
Today's assignment
Kick some ass!
And if you wanna be the teacher's pet
Well baby you just better forget
Rock got no reason
Rock got no rhyme
You better get me to school on time
This is my final exam
Now ya'll know who I am
I might not be that perfect son
But ya'll be rockin' when I'm done

You paint a picture
So it's plain to see
Ain't no hiding
No security
I'll be watching
Every move you make
When you hear the rattle
Better be awake
CHORUS:
Snake eyes, I'm watching
Snake eyes, look out
Snake eyes, it's coming
Snake eyes, ain't no escaping from the snake eye
(No way)
You leave a footprint
For my eye to see
Catch an echo
From a lock and key
From the shadow
Or behind a rock
Get you anywhere
From the darkest shack
CHORUS
Hear a rustle
From behind a tree
Get you running
Home to sanctuary
Bolt the door and -
You think you're safe
I'm coming to get you
Gonna reach out (???)
CHORUS
Got the snake eyes, they call me a snake in the bush
Snake eyes, biting
Snake eyes, always watching
Snake eyes
Ain't no escaping from the -
Just keep a lookout for the -
Snake eye

Blinded by a bright beam
Shattered by the windscreen
Stunned by the whiplash
I'm a victim of a bad crash
I can do nothing right
I never sleep at night
Can't even start a fight
My feet have left the ground
Spinning round and round
Spellbound, my world keeps a tumbling down
Beaten by a blind man
Wrong way up a dead end
Screaming through a speed trap
As I tear into a tail pipe
I can do nothing right
I never sleep at night
Can't even start a fight
My feet have left the ground
Spinning round and round
Spellbound, my world keeps a tumbling down
I'm slipping down
I got my hands in the fire
I'm sliding on an oil slick
Blinded on a bad trip
Yes and nothing's going to change it
I can do nothing right
Can't even sleep at night
My feet have left the ground
I'm spinning round and round
Spellbound, my world keeps a tumbling down

Honey roll over
And lettuce on top
Strap you to the bed
And make you rock
Run it up the flag
Send it on home
Push you to the wall
And make you moan
She's mine
Take what I want
Get what I need
Don't take it all
So don't you hide
Gonna blow my mind
C'mon taste it honey cause she feel fine
She turn it on, upside down
She turn me on, inside out
She turn it on, all around
She turn me on, she turn it on
Honey bend over
Touch your toes
She take over
The bomb explodes
A rockin' roller coaster
Flyin' off the top
Take you high diving
Off the long drop
She's mine
Take what I want
Get what I need
Don't take it all
Don't you hide
Gonna blow my mind
C'mon taste it honey cause she feel fine
She turn it on, upside down
She turn me on, inside out

She gave me her mind
Then she gave me her body
But it seemed to me
That she gave it to anybody
But I made her cry
And I made her scream
I took her high
And I curdled her cream
But how was I to know that she had been there before
She told me she was a virgin
She was number nine, ninety-nine on the clinical list
And I fell in love with the dirty little bitch
She's got the jack, she's got the jack
She's got the jack, she's got the jack
She's got the jack, she's got the jack
She's got the jack, she's got the jack
She's got the jack, jack, jack, jack, jack, jack, jack
She's got the jack
I searched her mind
And then I searched her body
But so did everybody
But she gave me her heart
And she gave me her soul
And a great, big - warn out
Empty hole
But how was I to know it had been filled in before
She said: Bon, I've never had the urgency
She was number nine, ninety-nine on the critical list
And I fell in love with the dirty little bitch
She's got the Jack

There's a small jail in georgia you all know,
Where the sun's so hot and the daylight don't show.
Where the moccasin she rests on a soft bed of sand,
You can hear the hound dog howling out the land.
Chorus:
It ain't the way i wanted it.
But lord that's the price you pay.
I said jailer bring me water for my throat is dry,
Four walls, steel bars, i've been watching passersby,
I've been sitting here so long i'm starting to cry,
The hangman's coming, i'm surely going to die.
Chorus:
It ain't the way i wanted it.
But lord that's the price you pay.
Oh, honk on it, boy,
A little jail cell blues here.
Lead break
I shot a man in macon over a poker game,
I killed another in atlanta just to build my fame,
Well, now i hear the hammers they're pounding out my name.
It ain't the way i wanted it.
But that's the price you pay.
It ain't the way i wanted it.
But lord that's the price you pay.
Hey jailer, how about that water my throat's still dry,
Four walls, steel bars, i've been watching passersby,
I've been sitting here so damn long i'm starting to cry,
The hangman's coming i'm surely going to die.
It ain't the way i wanted it.
But lord that's the price you pay,
(repeat),
It ain't the way i wanted it,
But lord that's the price you pay.
Oh, you done out of rope son.

The screen door slams
Mary's dress waves
Like a vision she dances across the porch
As the radio plays
Roy Orbison singing for the lonely
Hey that's me and I want you only
Don't turn me home again
I just can't face myself alone again
Don't run back inside
Darling you know just what I'm here for
So you're scared and you're thinking
That maybe we ain't that young anymore
Show a little faith, there's magic in the night
You ain't a beauty, but hey you're alright
Oh and that's alright with me
You can hide `neath your covers
And study your pain
Make crosses from your lovers
Throw roses in the rain
Waste your summer praying in vain
For a savior to rise from these streets
Well now I'm no hero
That's understood
All the redemption I can offer, girl
Is beneath this dirty hood
With a chance to make it good somehow
Hey what else can we do now
Except roll down the window
And let the wind blow back your hair
Well the night's busting open
These two lanes will take us anywhere
We got one last chance to make it real
To trade in these wings on some wheels
Climb in back
Heaven's waiting on down the tracks
Oh oh come take my hand
Riding out tonight to case the promised land
Oh oh Thunder Road, oh Thunder Road
Oh Thunder Road
Lying out there like a killer in the sun
Hey I know it's late we can make it if we run
Oh Thunder Road, sit tight take hold
Thunder Road
Well I got this guitar
And I learned how to make it talk
And my car's out back
If you're ready to take that long walk
>From your front porch to my front seat
The door's open but the ride it ain't free
And I know you're lonely
For words that I ain't spoken
But tonight we'll be free
All the promises'll be broken
There were ghosts in the eyes
Of all the boys you sent away
They haunt this dusty beach road
In the skeleton frames of burned out Chevrolets
They scream your name at night in the street
Your graduation gown lies in rags at their feet
And in the lonely cool before dawn
You hear their engines roaring on
But when you get to the porch they're gone
On the wind, so Mary climb in
It's a town full of losers
And I'm pulling out of here to win

The world is cracked
The sky is torn
I'm hanging in
You're holding on
I can't pretended
That nothing changed
Living in the shadows
Of the love we made
Back when we were beautiful
Before the world got small
Before we knew it all
Back when we were inocent
I wonder where it went
Lets go back and find it
Sha la la
Sha la la hey
Sha la la
Sha la la hey
Some dreams live
And some will die
But for you and me
Their still alive
Now am I blessed
Or am I cursed
Because the way we are
Ain't the way we were
Back when we were beautiful
Before the world got small
Before we knew it all
Back when we were inocent
I wonder where it went
Lets go back and find it
The world is cracked
The sky is torn
So much less
Then so much more
Back when we were beautiful
Before the world got small
Before we knew it all
Back when we were inocent
I wonder where it went
Lets go back and find it
Back when we were beautiful
Before the world got small
Before we knew it all
Back when we were inocent
I wonder where it went
Lets go back and find it
Back when we were beautiful

Give me a big beat
Now here this, now here this
Each generation rules the nation
Come on
Come on
Come on
Come on
She was a fast machine
She kept the motor clean
She was the bast damn woman that I'd ever seen
She had the sightless eyes
Tellin me no lies
Knocking me out with those american thighs
Takin more than her share
Had me fighting for air
She told me to come, but I was already there
'Coz the walls start shaking
The earth was quaking
My mind was aching
And we were making it you
You shook me all night long
Yeah, you
Shook me all night long
Working double time
On the seduction line
She was one of a kind, she's just mine all mine
She wanted no applause
Just another course
She made a meal out of me and came back for more
Had to cool down
To take another round
Now I'm back in the ring to take another swing
Cause the walls was shaking
The earth was quakin
My mind was achin
And we were making it you
Shook me all night long
Yeah, you
Shook me all night long
It knocked me out, and then you
Shook me all night long
Had me shakin' and then you
Shook me all night looong
Well, you took me
Well, you took me
Come on

Shot to the heart and your blame
Shot to the heart
Shot to the heart
Shot to the heart and your blame
Darlin', you give love a bad name
When your high, you never ever want to get down
So down
So down
So down, huh!

She was a fast machine
She kept her motor clean
She was the best damn woman I had ever seen
She had the sightless eyes
Telling me no lies
Knockin' me out with those American thighs
Taking more than her share
Had me fighting for air
She told me to come but I was already there
'Cause the walls start shaking
The earth was quaking
My mind was aching
And we were making it and you
Shook me all night long
Yeah you shook me all night long
Working double time
On the seduction line
She was one of a kind, she's just mine all mine
Wanted no applause
Just another course
Made a meal out of me and came back for more
Had to cool me down
To take another round
Now I'm back in the ring to take another swing
'Cause the walls were shaking
The earth was quaking
My mind was aching
And we were making it and you
Shook me all night long
Yeah you shook me all night long
And knocked me out and then you
Shook me all night long
You had me shakin' and you
Shook me all night long
Yeah you shook me
(Stop)

Shook me all night long
Yeah you, shook me all night long
Working double time on the seduction line

He's just mine all mine
Wanted no applause
It's just another cause
Made a meal out of me, and come back for more
Tried to cool me down
To take another round

Knocked me out, I said you
Shook me all night long
Had me shaking and you

Shook me all night long
Yeah you shook me
Yeah you shook me
All night long
